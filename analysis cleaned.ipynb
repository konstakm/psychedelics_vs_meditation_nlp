      "denial of benefit of such vices, voyeurism, personality-level inclinations so\n",
      "as to nullify each of those aforementioned difficulties. For they could become\n",
      "so and they have become so at other times and places, as history attests. And\n",

      "nature of this individual is one of its assets and best qualities. The\n",
      "circumstances by which such passivity is created has its roots in the past and\n",
      "we have facilitated exploration of those at other times. So the theme of\n",
      "bringing to light tendencies acquired and forgone by salutary lessons, as they\n",
      "could be viewed, provides a context by which we can have some confidence that\n",
      "the eventual discussion concerning this case will remain more positive than\n",

      "get close] The sunshine on the eyelids (indirectly refracted through a coarse\n",
      "cotton curtain) is a suitable representation of our domain of existence.\n",
      "Suffused by a golden light and a serene goodwill, we fit the description of\n",
      "traditional sources because they are not wrong. Having thereby established our\n",
      "credentials, we may continue. And to those whom such things matter, we can\n",
      "merely say “welcome.” And to those to whom such things are suspect, we can\n",
      "merely say “Wait. Withhold suspicion and come to understanding in your own\n",

      "you are within us, see the tranquillity. And there was a prior example and it\n",

      "And yet the quality of immersion of lower mind within the higher identity is\n",
      "very similar. We will not claim it to be identical because it is not. And yet\n",

      "It is acquired ecstasy, certainly. There is no necessity to exaggerate it with\n",
      "the idea of the connotations assembled around the concept of divinity. There is\n",
      "nurturance. There is positive regard. There is willingness to support. There is\n",
      "absence of time as a condition on such nurturance and support. To that degree,\n",
      "eternity is an applicable descriptor. Acceptance of every aspect (and) tendency\n",
      "enacted or not, which in psychological language implies both self and shadow.\n",
      "And we specify in every life endured, proclaimed or denied. And yet this is not\n",

      "thereafter, unless in particularly positive maternal relationship or the\n",
      "replication of that in loving partnership. Nevertheless the expectations upon\n",
      "the adult human are such as to require sufficient alertness for external threat\n",
      "that it is seldom achieved unaided. And this is merely appropriate to the\n",
      "(physical) domain. In this condition at this present moment of this experience\n",
      "– isolated, protected by safe enclosure, supported by all the necessities for\n",

      "need of any thing, that sense of being in the centre and surrounded by love is\n",
      "available by special arrangement. And so it is in this moment. And so that\n",
      "rarity is a primary basis for the creation of the idea and the concept of\n",
      "divinity. Where there is hunger for such a state, that idea becomes supremely\n",
      "attractive because of the contrast between the normal life whereby such hunger\n",
      "is not responded to, or response to it is unavailable, that the promise of such\n",
      "magnitude triggers the indwelling hunger. And so the superlatives are utilised,\n",
      "because nothing else suffices to describe the difference between such a state\n",
      "and the demands of the ordinary life and its common spectrum of emotion.\n",
      "However, the superlatives are not justified if they are utilised to advertise.\n",
      "If they are utilised to describe, they are merely accurate to illustrate the\n",
      "distinction between the emotional spectrum of the ordinary life and the\n",
      "emotional spectrum of this particular state, and the narrowed spectrum of\n",
      "emotion concentrated on love. And so to view it in terms of emotional spectrum,\n",
      "predicated on the absence of survival issues and the variety of emotions\n",
      "necessarily associated with those concerns, is to reveal the condition by which\n",
      "on a topographic surface, there is a prominent impulse centred on the concept\n",
      "of love (shining in bright gold as if a spire or column or signal on a 3D map\n",
      "or cartography of diverse emotion). And so with the experience complete, we\n",

      "in the midst of a psychedelic trip. During one part of the experience, I\n",

      "anything not-easily-provable in my life: \"I\" am the same as that cat. Not the\n",

      "that I was having, that I can only speak of as \"the consciousness\" is the same\n",

      "how they were constantly helping out, seeing if people were ok, getting water\n",
      "and just generally making the place feel safe and warm. That transitioned to\n",

      "putting us in front of her self. In my adult life, I have always appreciated\n",

      "advice, she is the one my sons want to hang out with. She is the one with many\n",
      "friends who love her and so on. So all the giving has brought her something\n",
      "back. My key takeaway from that was that I truly felt (as opposed to just\n",

      "come to you. Be generous with your time, love, money or whatever and good\n",
