meditation,There is a fundamental concept in Buddhism called anicca regarded as a basic truth of all things. To me it means change. The experiencing of all things changing is transforming. I woke up to experiencing my entire mind body phenomenon changing on every moment. Since then this experience has become routine. With it comes a letting go of past suppressive habits and instead a fluidity and serenity is there.
meditation,I developed all positive feelings. All thoughts in my mind looked like they were visible on a screen and I could for the first time in my life feel the bliss.
meditation,"I had recently lost my father unexpectedly. A month after his funeral I attended an empowerment and retreat for a ngondro that involved meditating on the 4 thoughts that turn the mind. I spent an entire weekend in meditating on death, impermanence, and the rarity or preciousness of a human rebirth. It broke me down to a grief stricken mess that on the other end helped me move forward through me grief. This meditation was then followed by an empowerment and teaching on beginning Dzogchen that led to first an existential crisis and then a freedom."
meditation,"There was an objective experience of the self (i.e. I, you, me, my) ""voice"" or ""mind-factor"" being a separate entity within the conscious experience for the first time in life. Then progressively over the retreat, the mind slowly detached from past and future experiences. It slowly started to become detached from the mind (finding dissatisfaction with the body). Eventually there was an ""unbinding"" from the body. Then there was an experience beyond both mind and matter. This mental state was experienced 1x in the afternoon, and then was repeated a second time the next day (i.e. it was repeatable using the same technique). It was a state that needs to be experienced in order to give it justice."
meditation,"Deep abiding peace with understanding of the impermanence of all experience. Calming of thought patterns, steadiness of concentration. Expansion of consciousness, cessation of all anxiety about existence."
meditation,Silence of mind and timelessness
meditation,"I was able to see Buddha seated in a grassy area, surrounded by trees and gemstones, like lapiz lazuli. There was a clear pond in front. It was a bright day. The sun was really shining bright. However, I began to have some thoughts like thoughts of people getting out of a building, some other thoughts I cannot remember. I did lose my focus sometimes in the middle."

We are nine persons this time  There where four men Jeku, Väkä, Häkä and Peter And five ladies Lena ,Pirkko Birgit and Anna , Tina All we have different education birthplaces - towns,different expectation "" different levels of intelligence"", some are married some are singles some have children some not Thema for this time was g o o d life and our experiences ,how we are living our life now after many years"" practising this raja yoga Finnish way"" We always start with music this time with very fine light piano music and we everyone told a bit our own experiences This was idea of our most experienced "" philosopher"" HE was the "" speaker"" I feel always to be ""more conscious ""awareness in and after the meeting I have different state of mind after this meeting..much stronger and happier"
meditation,"First, your survey structure is likely to miss many meaningful experiences because it assumes that meditation experiences are similar to drug experiences with some practice/duration as the substance/dosage. But meditation experiences aren't really like that — sure, there are discrete moments where things come clearer, or some experience of bliss suffuse the body, or imagery fills the mind. But the transformative part is really the slow chipping away. The fireworks are fun, but over the 15+ years that I've been meditating, I've learned that they're mostly a pleasant distraction. And that’s because, at least in the traditions I work in, the higher realizations are fully non-conceptual and non-phenomenal. So I've had a bunch of discrete experiences that might sound sound really exciting and meaningful. But the really powerful transformations have not been due to discrete moments, but continuous proactive. My experience is that I was laying in bed, reading a book on Dzogchen. I had been meditating very regularly for the previous 8 months, usually at least twice a day for 20-40 minutes a session. I had been practicing mostly shamatha meditation on the breath, and without an object. I had also been reading a lot of books on Dzogchen, and has been practicing a great deal of “looking for the looker” kinds of practices. As I laid in bed, I read for the umpteenth time that mind essence is empty and cognizant and unlimited. I looked up at the ceiling to see whether it was like that. Suddenly, for the first time, I saw that the subject is absent, yet bright and comprehending. Totally absent in every way, yet somehow everywhere present, like a fifth dimension slicing through everything but without any characteristics whatsoever. Anyway, it was suddenly just clear, like the subject side was just this openness. Nothing changed. And I had a sense of Champagne bubbles rising up in my heart. That was it. As I checked again and again over the following days, the power and veracity of this realization persisted, even depended. And over the last 1.5 years, it’s deepened progressively and the result is sense of freedom and spontaneous joy in the midst of phenomena. Amazing!"
meditation,"I felt all thinking was still there, but it was behind my back and I could stay resting in mind, or as it is sometimes put - resting in the natural state of mind. There was experiential layer to this as well, and it was twofold: something that could be described as 1) heaven (vast, uplifted, tranquil, pure and blissful), and also 2) not so specified, more basic, or something that feels like being in contact with base. I have had this several times when I meditate more (4-10 hours per day, then it comes in one of the meditation sessions). I was doing odo visualization with less actual visual part, but more just being present in the atmosphere of the story. I did several odo meditations, the story in this one was: there was a rainbow coloured gem and it radiated rainbow light transforming earth to rainbow colours. Rainbow coloured flowers grew from the earth and they formed a new level over earth, then more grew and there became level after level. ""The bearer of light"" climbed from level to level (we identify with the bearer when doing this) and then they stood on a festive canopy for a moment, before turning to rainbow light oneself too. (Odo is a Finnish tradition from 1980 with connections to Tibetan Buddhist types of thinking, there is some info on webpage odonet.fi)."
meditation,"It's really simple. I remember the time when I realized the importance of breath work. I had used breathing techniques prior for my own pain, for calming & shared with clients, students and my own child. We talked about the time between the in and out breath. I became more curious about using breath work for a variety of physical & mental health issues. So far so good!"
meditation,"It is very difficult to say which of the meditation experiences is the most meaningful since the whole point of meditation (Vipassana) is not to rate the experiences, just observe sensations in the body and thought that come and go. The practice is simply scanning the body from head to toe. First I was thinking about picking a moment from a vipassana meditation retreat (silent 10 days) but maybe the most meaningful moment is when I learned to use the meditation technique during my sleep paralyzes that I have suffered from since approximately 8 years old. Since you asked about an experience in a facilitated setting I first say that I took part in a 10 day silent Vipassana retreat, there were volunteers and a teacher and many 50 other people, we work up very early and meditated maby 10 hours a day with brakes of course, in a hall with pillows and blankets. For me the sitting was very very painful. My back was in so much pain. But there was moments when despite the uncomfortable feelings, I got so into the detailed experiences, the sensations in my own body that I felt very good. The experience get so nuanced and becomes so interesting and the senses sort of open up or get trained for noticing. It is very difficult to cut apart one experience from another. I just started to pay so much attention to details to sounds to textures… that the thing that first felt boring and painful started to feel something much more too. When starting to pay attention to ”I am tired” in a meditation for example… what does it mean, the little muscles behind my eyes feel sore, some pressure in my temples and neck and so on. Or the pain in my back. I could observe it very closely, how the pain moves, the warmness of the muscles, tightness. And often by paying attention the pain dissolves, it felt like massage. In there I really felt the mind and body connection. When I am not present, the body remembers it… and it remembers and carries also emotions. So about the setting. I had my own pillow and place next to so many others, we were advised not to talk or take eye contact so that we could fully concentrate, every now and the the teacher that was always sitting silently in the front would check if we are able to move our attention from one body part to another. He just asked this and we said yes or no. For me personally he advised not to control my breathing since I was forcing it like in Ashtanga yoga because i thought i could avoid the pain in my back somehow by doing that. I am healthy and there is nothing wrong in my back I have to sat by the way. The pain was somehow more like some stored trauma or something I don't even know.  Then about the sleeping paralyzes: The feeling in those sleep paralyzes (unihalvaus) is a complete fear of death, I cant move and somebody is sitting on my chest or entering the room trying to kill me, it’s pure terror and at those moments one can't really reason that it is just a dream. I had this unihalvaus again since a very early age and I was 29 at the time when this happened. I was in my apartment in a safe environment sleeping with my boyfriend and my dog. I had the experience that i was paralyzed, I couldn't move or ask for help. Always a similar scenario happens, Dream gets mixed up with reality and i feel as if someone is entering the door and attacking me. So it was this time, i don't recognize the Person attacking in the dream that feels reality. In the middle of it I somehow remembered the meditation technique and started to focus on my breathing or the sensations on my face when the air moves. In a split second the ”attack” or unihalvaus ended and I could move again and completely wake up. The strange thing is I never had unihalvaus after that again and i have had those regularly as long as I remember. The key feeling in that moment was surrendering of acceptance of what is happening. It is very hard to do and to explain to anyone who hasn't had a unihalvaus, cause in that moment it really feels like someone is trying to kill you, it is so real, it is so realistic. In that moment meditation is a risk, and it feels like risking your life, cause you can not now whether you really are getting killed. That is often something people without this experience seem to undermine.I felt so good that I was able to mediate in that moment. And I never have had that unihalvaus experience again. Later I thought unihalvaus is like a bodily trauma that is trapped in, maybe something unconscious. I know the official explanations too, but that's how i feel."
meditation,"The 'Experience' happened not as a one-off but, I see now, in stages: build-up_ bursting forth_ receding_ re-opening... At the time, I did not understand what was going on for me & it was painful, scary, overwhelming, exciting, meaningful, confusing... Build-Up: For some time (months?) I had been practising the Jesus Prayer with a somatic attention on my heart area. Then I went on a working pilgrimage to Mt. Athos (home of the Prayer) & was able to maintain a much greater continuity of practice without ceasing. Over time, this heart area (centre of my chest) was beginning to hurt & ache - drawing my attention increasingly. As I practised, I self-developed a more total, holistic approach & understanding of the prayer: somatic - body awareness_ humility - surrendering myself before Christ_ heartful - longing for the Divine, loving_ mindful - always attentive & chanting silently... During the pilgrimage, many surprising, lucky - what I would call blessed - opportunities & synchronicities started happening to me. I felt that I was being guided by mystical, good beings (EG: a friend monk who had recently died)... Upon my return to the UK, this continued from time to time, but otherwise my life was quite normal & my behaviour not-so-different (not more 'Holy!'), & with much less prayer/practice. But, when I tried to bend the truth a little, or lie, or be mean, it hurt in my heart area & I couldn't really carry it out. Prior to this time, by the way, I had tried to get to grips with this practice & never really developed an effective relationship with it. Soon, I went on a Theravada Buddhist meditation retreat (mindfulness/vipassana), as normal. During that retreat, I practised diligently, letting go of the Christian Jesus Prayer & instead focussing on 'Buddhist' mindfulness, but realising that I still needed to bring my attention, as unceasingly as possible, to my heart-area. Now I began to develop the 'neti neti' practice of 'not this_ not this': continuously letting go of identification with any experience. Ceasing to grasp anything. I realised much later that this was a crucial stage in what happened to me. Many insights & experiences happened (for example uncontrollable joy spilling forth, creative flow, less need for sleep, etc). These kinds of experiences I am used to in retreats, but it was immediately following the retreat that was so exceptional. So much happened & the circumstances rather complicated (I began an ill-advised romantic relationship with a fellow retreatant!), that I cannot explain it all in detail here. However, in summary: Bursting forth (over about 48 hrs): At first, I had no need for sleep. I think I was awake the whole night, full of energy. I was super emotionally open, trusting, barrierless (hence the rapid relationship). I was incredibly creative & in flow-state: I was giving a presentation to a school & spontaneously made it rhyme. I felt that I connected with the children in the audience in a deep & direct way: when I looked into their eyes, I saw their 'old souls in young bodies'. They, & many people were very drawn to me. I was healing deep emotional wounds (eg. in a conversation with colleagues). All of this was mostly enjoyable, positive, light experience. What was most disconcerting, though, was taking the busy London Underground across the city, dealing with crowds & finding that their thoughts and feelings were entering into me. I could feel what they were feeling & thinking. Extreme empathy, if you like. But, it was uncontrollable & overwhelming, coming as it was from all directions. Desperate, I eventually escaped to another friend's house & had to lie down for some hours, grounding myself. Receding: The intensity of the heart-pain, empathy/mind-reading, energetic states, etc began to recede with time, but fluctuating. I was scared after that intense bursting forth in London (I had returned to my small town in the countryside). I wanted to ground & not escalate. I was looking for answers as to what was going on for me (for a long time before & after the last stage), but didn't find them from any of the spiritual teachers I consulted. None of them seemed to understand/recognise my 'spiritual symptoms', which was very disappointing. I didn't know what I was supposed to 'do' with any of this. Apart from outright mystical experiences, I was just the same: no more holy/good/evolved/wise! How should I continue to practice with these sensations?... Gradually, normal busy life took over again & the synchronicities/guidance, heightened empathy/sensitivity, etc. mostly receded. I put the 'Experience' down to what Hindus call Heart Chakra opening, but I still didn't have many answers. I worried less that I was having a heart attack! Re-Opening: However, about 2(?) years later, I went on another Buddhist meditation retreat & again focussed my attention on my heart area. After that retreat, I continued to practice my own kind of mindful, heart-focussed, deep relaxation, letting go meditation. My heart would release so much heat that I would get pronounced red handprints on my chest whilst leaving my hands to rest there (I have photos). Again, the empathy, intuitiveness, peace, etc re-emerged - but less intensely this time. It still definitely felt like a continuation / re-opening, though, rather than any 'new' experience. Still seeking clearer, fuller answers, finally a meditator friend recommended the book 'A Path with Heart', by Jack Kornfield. Here was the fullest explanation & guidance that I had been seeking! It made total sense & accurately described my experiences. For that, I will always be grateful. Years later, I feel that if I was to continue the practices diligently enough, those experiences would be accessible to me again. However, I am not searching for 'mystical' experiences & understand better now that they alone do not make a wise, nor Holy life..."
meditation,"My meditation experienced happened during a 3 weeks self retreat that I did in a retreats center in Israel. In this retreat I practiced Anatta, with Vipassana practice I was practicing to watch how the self is constructed. I think the experience was around the middle of the retreat, it was the end of the summer, the weather was very nice, and it was during my evening meditation. I did the meditation outside, in the open air, surrounding by trees & open skies with stars, and the sound of crickets around me. I started a mindfulness meditation, starting with being aware of the breath, and moving on to the sound surround me. as the meditation got deeper, the body was more relaxed and ease, I added to the practice the Anatta view - only sound (without I'm hearing the sound), staying in this state I stated to feel that I'm one with nature, with the sounds around me, I felt that there's no separation between me and the world. This was an amazing feeling, to understand and feel for some moments what is the nonduality that the practice is talking about,"
meditation,"This experience happened during my first meditation retreat, at the latter part of the week. It was the last sitting of the day, we sat silently together in the meditation hall. I was sitting as comfortably as I could, but I suffered relatively severe pain due to spine fracture. I don't remember if I started the sitting with body scan or not, but it's very likely I did, because it was an important part of my meditation routine. The ""actual practice"" was metta, I used phrases, or more accurately, I explored the phrases and was curious about what resonated. The practice followed traditional sequence, starting from the easiest object, turning to neutral, difficult and finally, to the whole existence.  I remember that ""the Hindrances"" visited me during the sitting every now and then, especially in the beginning. Particularly aversion, resisting the pain, and doubt, regularly appeared. I had an intention to be vigilant with them, to see them, to invite them like I would invite a good friend and have a cup of tea with me, and allowed my mind to visualize them as a small creatures. I felt at ease with them, sometimes just mentally noted ""I see you (Mara)"" or ""hello my friend, please join me"". So my mind didn't get disturbed or confused with them. I also used my breath to ease the tightness and pain in the body, breathing space and exploring what kind of breath or way of being allowed me to relax and welcome the pain.  So the practice started with the metta practice that was combined with vipassana -kind of meditation and working with the hindrances. And then, when ""I was ready"" felt strong intention and connection with the metta, I dropped the phrases and just rested with the kindness. Very few thoughts emerged and I just allowed them to go. A few times I felt almost unbearable amount of energy passing through my body, for a moment I was afraid my bones would break, but I felt safe and knew I could trust the practice, so these experiences just came and then passed away, and didn't dominate the sitting. The intention was to be fully aware of the experience of being alive, and I wanted to appreciate, to fully feel, the whole body of the breath that kept me alive. So the practice changed a little, there was the strong metta quality but also awareness of the breath, that I felt through my whole body (I didn't try to focus on any part of the body). I allowed awareness to increase with every inhale and then let go with every exhale. I felt like surfing with very pleasant waves and I had the mental vision, like I was a living cave, very kind and sensitive and fully alive type of cave at the seaside, half in the water, and the breaths were waves washing and nourishing the cave. All of them were different and unique, and strong appreciation and joy made it easy to be aware each of them, how they expressed themselves through my body.  The awareness, clarity, unconditional kindness and care I experienced was stunning. I felt like I had encountered something that had always been there but invisible to me before. This was not rational or verbal experience and it's not possible to describe it with the words. The ease, safety, deep care and love, presence, pleasure I experienced, it was a fundamental release and relief. This loving and deeply caring awareness was able to hold everything, even the suffering and pain that was unbearable to me. I wasn't dreaming or lost in my mind but very intimately and deeply connected to the reality and the body, the intensive pain was still there and my legs were numb at that point, but the pain didn't disturb or bother me at all, I was completely at ease with everything. Meditation felt easy and pleasant and I could have continued it much longer, there was a desire to do so, but when the meditation bell rang I stayed only for a moment. I recognized that the kindest thing was to stand up and allow my body to move, my legs needed it."
meditation,"Online retreat with a friend at a summerhouse. Early in the morning I went on a walk. Beautiful sunshine. I thought about my spiritual friend with whom I had a MDMA session 3 weeks prior this retreat and how it helped me. I had a vision ( which I occasionally have had without any substances) about a little girl age 4-5 in the middle of us and we were holding her hands. We were walking towards a huge image of christal clear light. It was like an angel and was a reflection of unconditional love and care. It was deeply touching, warm and filled almost the whole vision field. The day began with yoga. Teacher then read a sutta and reflection on First Nobel Truth about suffering. Someone was kind of depressed and teaching was, this is the beginning on the path to enlightenment. This is not delusion. Suddenly the message touched me like an energy wave in my forehead, then my chest area and finally deep in the lower belly. It was both shaking and supporting, very moving and tears came. This is my First Noble Truth: I have tried always to make up my identity in various ways, self improvement projects and skills, scattered around a center like petals in a flower and I never feel enough or whole."
meditation,"I centred deep in my heart, the thoughts started to lose importante, breath calmed down, - this during a period of approximately 1 h, after many meditations of this type. Suddenly I felt an immense love, I felt full of light, and a very intimate and tremendous Presence in my being, one that I could never forget, and that I can connect to many time thereafter."
meditation,"I had been walking in the forest all day, connecting with nature, speaking in my heart to the life of the forest. At the end of the day, it was late autumn and cool in the hills, we gathered around a fire in a cottage in the forest. I lay down for comfort, head on my pack for a pillow, closed my eyes and connected with my heart, and nature, through the days experiences. After revisiting all the places of interest, and feeling deeply at peace with the day, and not expecting anything else, it had been a good day. Suddenly my vision changed, inner vision, my eyes were closed. I was somewhere else, and knew it was beside the Sea of Galilee, and a man was approaching me out of the gloaming. I knew it to be Jesus, and he knew me, and we embraced, and I had thought him to be dead from the crucifixion. As I touched his arm I felt in my arm a searing pain from the palm of my hand up into my neck, it really hurt, and he was speaking to me, but I could not hear his words. My soul called me back, and I said ""No! I want to hear the words of Jesus."" My soul said ""you do not need to hear the words, they are in you now, and you have become the words. You must come now."" (This was very moving for me, I had never experienced a visionary experience like this. For the next seven years it was the background of my life, the words , often with accompanying visions, reappearing in meditations to become workshops and books.) (This took place when I was about sixty years old, after fifteen years of meditation experience_ now I am over eighty and the words are still coming) (the words are without exception positive, loving, healing, and a delight to live with.)"
meditation,I was lying on my bed meditating when I saw clearly my son seated in front of a window drinking from a mug. My son was 5000 miles away at the time.It was so vivid I drew a sketch of it .I asked him what he had been doing at that exact time. He said he was seated at a desk in front of a window drinking coffee. I asked him to send me a photo of himself in that position .It was identical with what I had drawn. I believe I was remote viewing
meditation,"First of all it is important to say I have had so many of these experiences it is difficult to choose which one now. I have gone with the one that happened during the mindfulness rather than the experience of the dream or experience afterwards which is a common effect for me when I meditate before bedtime. This occasion I was attending training for MBIR Mindfulness Based Inner Repatterning and the facilitator led us into a mindfulness state which as she proceeded to ask us to bring in colours opened up a garden that I was in the centre of. The garden increased in growth, volume, colours and sounds as she asked us to bring in more colours. This became the most blissful experience I had ever encountered and as the garden grew into the whole planet the vision became and felt more and more like the garden of Eden. In fact I was convinced it was the garden of Eden. There were waterfalls, sparkles, smells and tastes of abundance everywhere I turned. I didn't see any people just me and the garden and this growing intensity of belonging and that I was home. It felt like I was there a very long time, yet not long enough, when she brought us back into the room it was with real reluctance that I came back. It had been only a minute or two. As we progressed throughout the day doing more of this I was able to go back once more to that beautiful place and watch and feel the plants growing, whispering to each other and it felt sublime,"
meditation,"- at the 10th day of 14 day Vipassana retreat - sharper observation of thought created in my mind - depersonalization from them - sudden awareness, that there is no ""I"", just a train of these thoughts - somehow they were created and then the observer is a"
meditation,I was attending a course on meditation with an Indian lady that was considered a guru. There were 20 or 30 fellow in the course sitting in the hall. After days of trying to meditate sitting silently with nothing happening and some disappointment I remember viewing myself waking up rapidly a large steir in a building with pink walls well lighted without any windows.  At a curve of the stairs on the left side some hard paper containers full up of old papers were turning upside down from the air inside the large stairs in front of me. Many sheets of old typed-written papers were flowing near me and on me. Then the image dissolved.
meditation,"((Because I look back on a long life and have practiced meditation for 40 years already, I can impossibly name one single occasion which is MOST meaningful , but I promise this was one of the important & meaningful experiences in my life.))  (It was a time in my life when I felt a bit tense and unhappy about my life's situation. I tried to practice meditation twice a day, but the usual day to day stress was a distraction. Now I was on a holiday at the seaside.On a cloudy windy summer day, I sat for meditation on the sand of the beach. Looking at the sea and sky. I had a question in my mind about my life, but I don't remember.) While doing my regular practice of recitation and visualization, I became more and more calm, peaceful, deeply relaxed. I felt a nearness of the visualised deity (a Buddha). It felt like friendship, care, protection. An answer to my unexpressed question arose out of my innermost being, coming from very deep, where there is silence and peace. The voice was really extremely low & soft. If there had been any other inner chat, it would have covered this low deep voice. The answer was really wise. (...it appeared surprisingly wise in that moment and it turned out to be really wise in long-term view.) Then, although my eyes were shut, it appeared as if I was sitting under a light. Bright like a street light. It felt like I was sitting under a yellow street lamp in the night. (But it was daylight, afternoon, and rain started to fall, but I didn't really get wet, because I had some shelter by a roofed wicker beach chair. When I opened my eyes, there was a huge double rainbow, seemingly only 30 meters beside me, bowing from the sand into the sea.) Due to all of this, the experience seemed to be very meaningful. I felt protected, save, relieved, glad, grateful, happy and soothened."
meditation,"The experience allowed me to see that I'm not a solid fixed thing. In fact ""I"" am a fluid mind/matter phenomenon. I was in in the middle of a 10 day meditation course. It was the result of sustained meditative effort. This experience changed my relationship to my ego, and lead to an understanding of other people's suffering due to their attachment to self (ego)"
meditation,"I was aware of rewire an old patter of my mind by observing the impermanence of certain negative feelings and by not identifying with them, and this caused a lot of rapture."
meditation,"I had been meditating using the technique of Dzogchen for a bit over a year. It promises to deliver an experience of no-self. In Buddhism it is always stressed that you cannot describe the experience so much as point to it. So while I expected to eventually have some sort of realization experience I didn't know what that would be like.  This particular day, I was doing my daily 20 minute session at home when my physical body seemed to dissolve into its surroundings. All that was left was a field of sense data, with no one there to observe it. My sense of self as the observer dissolved with my body. I felt a sense of oneness with everything. My experience was expansive and stretched as far as anything I could perceive. Thoughts were sparse and as impersonal as passing clouds, just like physical sensations, visual appearances, transient sounds, etc. I had glimpsed this sense of emptiness before but this was somehow deeper. Like the meditator experiencing the emptiness was nowhere to be found.  The most profound part of this experience for me was the compassion that came over me during it. I realized that until this experience of not being separate from the rest of my perceptions and from the phenomenological world, my compassion practice had always been forced. Like I was being compassionate because I knew that I should. But it wasn't automatic. And it often left me feeling drained. After having this experience, there was a very distinct sense of oneness with reality. An experience like that makes compassionate automatic. There’s literally no difference between myself and others. So why did I always try so hard to be compassionate to others, while not taking care of myself?  That was my big takeaway. That I'm one of the people I'm supposed to love, just like the people I was always trying to please. Everyone says you're no good to anyone else until you take care of yourself, but having a direct experience of the truth of that statement was a different thing altogether."
meditation,"It was my first retreat, an introduction to ngondro retreat. It was at Pema Osel Ling near Santa Cruz. 28 years ago. Anam Thubten Rinpoche was teaching. There were about 8 of us in a small room in the sangha house. I don't remember what Rinpoche was teaching about. I think he had strayed from ngondro into some dzogchen. I was meditating while receiving the teaching (which one should always do) and I figured I'd try this cool visualization from the guru yoga section of the ngondro I'd just learned. Must work better with an actual lama than a visualized one, right? They hadn't told us you could do it that way, but... The visualization is a chakra-and-lights affair, receiving the four empowerments from the guru's three chakras to mine - white body/forehead, red speech/throat, blue mind/chest, and a five colored sphere from heart to heart. After I'd done that, Rinpoche seemed to have noticed I was doing something. He stopped talking and looked at my stomach area, as if to study it? It called my attention to it anyway. In other systems of guru yoga I've seen since, I believe you use that chakra for the fourth empowerment instead of the heart. Then he looked straight at me, and asked, ""How did you get here?"" Was he asking whether I drove the back way to get there? Was he asking how I'd become interested in Buddhism? My mind stopped. It was a fucking koan. I figured ""Here I am"" was an acceptable response but it sounded dumb when I said it. I should have just remained slack-jawed. It lit me up like a Christmas tree. Nyams nyams nyams. Bliss, clarity, non-thought. Literally felt like I could see through the walls to the trees beyond and through the roof to the moon and stars above. All sound was mantra. Like I could hear each sound, but each had a mantra, like vajrasattva, being mumbled along with it. Blissful energy. Vast open awareness. Better than acid. From Lama Tharchin's Dudjom Tersar Ngondro commentary: ""Guru yoga is the method for receiving... the direct transmission of wisdom from the Guru's mind to your mind. Transmission really means receiving the taste of enlightenment... Someone who has received the Guru's mind transmission has no choice but to attain enlightenment, just as someone falling down a steep mountain totally out of control has no choice but to fall all the way to the bottom.,, ""Thinking of the gurus qualities, how amazing and extraordinarily fortunate you are to have met a teacher like this, you may feel the hair on your body stand up or you may cry without control. Experiences will arise and suddenly your mind will change to pure Awareness. All normal phenomena will cease. Meditation experiences will arise effortlessly and spontaneously."" That was all happening, just like in the book. After the teaching I asked his assistant if I could talk to him. I wanted to ask him to be my teacher. I went to his cabin. He was quite cross with me, only time I've ever seen him cross. I told him about my experiences and he practically scoffed. ""Those are just nyams. They aren't enlightenment and are very dangerous to get attached to."" I left quite deflated, though still with all the psychedelic effects still blazing in my brain. It took another day for the nyams to subside. I never did tell him I did the guru yoga visualization with him. I figured maybe it was like sexual harassment, doing guru yoga uninvited. Or maybe that was for advanced practitioners and this was my first retreat.  I was quite suspicious of nyams after that. I'd gotten the transmission, but I didn't know what to do with it. I bogged down in doing ngondro and quit. But I didn't have a dzogchen practice I could do. He was quite vague about just sitting there. I drifted away from him and dharma. Over a quarter century later I stumbled across Lama Lena, another dzogchen master. All her teachings are free on youtube. Her take on nyams is quite different and more positive. They can feel great. They're a sign of progress, but they are not that progress. They're like a sign on the road that says ""San Francisco 75 miles."" You don't pull over next to the sign and stop just because it names your destination. Keep going! Don't try to hang onto them. Don't try to get back an experience you had last Tuesday! (Since you're studying nyams, you might be interested. If you go to https://lamalenateachings.com/dzogchen-levels-beginner-intermediate-advanced/ and search for nyams you'll find it in the transcript.) I've concluded that all the psychedelic fireworks were nice and impressive, but the important part was that open vastness that went with them. ""Tawa longchen rabjam yin. The view is the infinite vast expanse."" So I did get transmission. It just took me a quarter century to figure out what it was and what to do with it. LL is a genius. And she doesn't require ngondro as a prerequisite! This happened 16 years before my first manic episode and diagnosis. It only lasted a couple days. I'm not sure how to make sense of it psychologically. Brief psychotic episode I guess.  How does this affect my everyday life? In dzogchen, first one is introduced to tawa, the view. Then the meditation is at all times and on all occasions, noticing the previously recognized tawa, dharmakaya, nature of mind. So I'm doing that. I still get nyams, mild ones in comparison to that first experience, and I just let them slide on by. No need to shout ""p'hat!"" to get rid of them. Hope that helps."
meditation,"I went on a 4 day retreat and on the 2nd or 3rd day, we gathered in the meditation hall for a guided meditation with bikkhus and retreat attendants. The meditation involved envisioning our parents as little children and experiencing their fear/anxiety as children. Having had a complex and routinely difficult relationship with my father up to this point in my life, this exercise was transformative. I had not really thought of my father as the product of his tumultuous upbringing_ his fears, anxieties and such. That said, I broke down sobbing throughout the meditation as waves of compassion and understanding washed over me. I was able to see that my father and I were not separate but the same. That the same fears and anxieties that I had my whole life were no different than his. I envisioned him as a little kid witnessing his father beat his mother and siblings while he sat there terrified. I touched those feelings in myself and wept. I then expanded the scope to every human being who ever lived and realized that we are all the same and was able to touch compassion and understanding for everyone that has ever lived. I felt connected to others in a way that had never happened before. It was a truly beautiful experience. (As a result of this experience, the relationship with my father was forever altered. I was able to interpret his every unwholesome action with the eyes of compassion and did not take it personally. Any residual resentments were washed away. I treated him with love and understanding moving forward from this experience until he passed away. Our relationship was healthy and positive from then on. I am very grateful for the experience.)"
meditation,"losing boundaries of body, wideness, joy and stillness which I more or less often experience additional  release of tension/sorrow/pain about health issues of children, experiencing them as not my suffering but THE suffering, being somehow not a problem but perfect manifestation of the unspeakable"
meditation,The experience of ultimate calmness
meditation,"Retreat at a buddhist center for five days, Vipassana. Feeling of deep peace, absolute silence."
meditation,"I was doing a Samatha-vipassana styled meditation in a 5 day retreat. The Experience happened at the 4th day in evening meditation. I had been meditating about 10 hours per day on the retreat and 2 hours a day for past 2 years before the retreat.  Practice was just letting go of all arising phenomena. Before ""the Experience"" I have had strong energy sensations for years. Body being full of wave like tingling, losing the experience of body to this wider field of energetic experience. Lots of old memories running through the field of experience variating with euphoric peaceful silence. In ""The Experience"" I was suddenly existing and experiencing the room I was meditating in for multiple perspectives at same time. The visual sense was very vivid as I was kind of this formless entity getting data for all angles at the same time. Then the experience collapsed into a sort of a energy current that flowed back to my body. Important factor was that I was that energy flowing into a body.  After the experience, all experiences felt like they are as important. There was no hierarchical structure what I thought was better than an another experience. It felt like being in a ""perfect"" mindset, as the inner critic was gone. Everything felt like this is the way it needs to be. The struggle was over, I overcame the illusion of control over the things I can't change. Clarity of things was something I had never experienced. as all the negative feelings felt necessary in order for the world to be built as it is. There was no trying, no fear of a mindset fading away, it did not feel constructed, it felt like most natural state of mind to be. I walked away from the meditation hall and ate a bun, and I felt no difference in meditating versus non meditating. I was in the awe of the ordinary."
meditation,"I was in deep rest meditation retreat doing lying meditation and engaged with soulmaking dharma practice. I tuned into pleasant sensations in my body wanting to give ground for arising of samadhi. I felt my breath flowing through the body without an effort: the breath felt like a line from my head going to the toes. I imagined that the breath would come also from the earth filling my body with loving kindness. The breath felt like a soft touch. I tuned also into the space feeling spacious awareness. The space held me with loving kindness, almost like an image of Avalokiteshvara would hold me in her hand and there I'm just lying like a baby without a worry. The distinction between my body and the space was becoming lesser. I tuned into the possibility that there’s something more. I engaged with the practice because I wanted to know soulfulness. I wanted to explore can soul be made out of dukkha_ can one go beyond dukkha (which had been present on a small degree during that retreat day). My body felt open and co-operative. I sensed there are many possibilities and meaningfulness and I was touched by this insight. I felt I was meeting or touching divinity in my experience that was both there and not there. I was ready to meet something that is more than me. I felt piti arising and I allowed myself to enjoy.  Then an image arised. It was both intentional and unintentional - I was open for the image. Two men looking at me above from the roof. They were miniatures. One of them represented sexual archetype and the other represented protector. I felt loving and being loved. I could feel them looking right at me, just staring with pure love. My rational mind tried to interrupt this by saying ”oh this is just an image, you are not special, why would they love you personally but not the others in the hall?”. I trusted the image and allowed the love to come. I didn't want to limit their these mens’ autonomy. I felt I was personally loved and that really opened my heart center feeling my body tingling and emotional. Then I invited my partner into the image that I was improvising with. I didn't know was the image pure projection but it didn't feel like it. I really gave them autonomy. So my partner and suddenly my dog appeared in the roof also as miniatures. They looked happy. I wanted to apologize to them. I said ”for the ways I have narrowed you, seen you flatly or used you for my own agenda, I ask you for your forgiveness”. I continued: ”thank you for appearing to me as you are. You make my life richer. I love you and I want to know you. I wanna come closer to you. I bow to you”. Suddenly they jumped from the roof and turned into human/dog size bodies. My partner would start playing piano that was next to me filled with joy and happiness. He was singing ”me and the Dana-dog love you” or something like that. Dana-dog was actually dancing on his two legs. I was having a real fun watching them to manifest as they are - I was astonished. They stroke me with their beauty. I felt enormous love in my heart. I felt that my mind wasn't controlling the image at all. Then my partner ran into my lap, hugged me really tightly and kissed me all over the face. I felt hugely loved. I started to cry and now that I'm writing this, I have pre-tears coming to my eyes. This image felt and feels so meaningful. During the meditation I said quietly out loud ”thank you, thank you, thank you” for my partner and the dog. I was filled with gratitude while enjoying this emotional, transforming waterfall. After the meditation I knew that this practice was onward leading. I felt like I'm on the right path. I felt open and loving, I could feel metta arising from my body and permeating the whole space with loving kindness. Also, the image taught me about unfathomable beyonds. I could see my partner as dimensional being shading into divinity. I could see him separate from the mundane way of looking. I was so happy of this especially that we have had challenging times. I felt like this meditation experience wasn't just happening at one point of the time but it was rather eternal, always there, beyond time. This experience transformed my life somehow and I know I'm capable of loving and I'm also allowed to be loved."
meditation,"This was my first 'mystical' experience during meditation which is probably why it had such a big impact on me. I was participating in a meditation course about ""engaged dharma"". During one of the course meetings we were asked to reflect on what is meaningful for us and what we think we should do in this life. Kind of a 'what is the purpose of my life' question. The instructions were just to drop the question inside and then to feel our body and see if anything comes up. No other instructions were given and the meditation was in silence. I dropped the question inside and sat my eyes closed feeling my whole body. Suddenly, I felt a space opening inside me and totally unexpectedly I saw the whole universe, with all the galaxies and stars, inside me. It's very hard to describe but it was really really beautiful. I also had a sense that I was not a separate being anymore but somehow a part of this whole. I had never imagined such an experience but I recognized it straight away from the Indian legend where the foster mother of Shri Krishna looks in his mouth to find out whether he has been stealing butter and sees the whole universe in his mouth. I don't think it was a conscious thought as such, but somehow this recognition made the experience less scary, like it was already familiar, something that others have experienced and described. This helped me to stay calm even if the dissolution of myself was scary. In this vast space I felt, rather than heard, the word ""service"". It was not in any specific language but I just knew it and I recognized that it was the truth - that the purpose of my life is to serve everything that exists, the whole creation. I felt a rush of joy and relief, and tears started streaming from my eyes. The emotions were quite overpowering and kind of took over the experience, so the image faded away and I was back in my body again. The meditation was only a short one, maybe 20 minutes, but I kept sitting and feeling my body and emotions even when the others came out of the sitting and the teacher started to give a talk."
meditation,"I was sitting doing an open meditation. I remembered a nightmare I'd recently had when on retreat. I brought the nightmare imagery to mind and just stayed with it, letting it play out and just trying to sit with what was happening rather than 'being scared'. The theme was meeting death. I suddenly had an experience of the scariest bit flipping into something completely benign/benevolent/fundamentally ok. Almost as if the demons of death suddenly became (or are recognised as) angels. I had a deep sense of everything being OK. Also an image of a satellite at the furthest point of its orbit turning to 'home'."
meditation,"I was on a mat for Holotropic Breathwork ®. My journey began with me having the experience of being dead and buried. I didn't have fear so much as I had concern that the others in the room would not notice I had died. The atmosphere was a grey and formless landscape and my concern. It stayed that way for a time and I eventually began to feel movement in my bodily Transpersonal form. It was a slow movement as though I were unfolding myself from the Earth. When I fully emerged and shook the dirt from my being, I found myself to be a very large stone goddess. I could see through its eyes and feel slow walking movement through its body. I walked and walked through the grey landscape until I reached what felt to be the right place to fold myself back into the Earth. With each movement of folding this leg or that arm, I saw that I was forming into Earth herself ... A mountain, a breeze blowing through evergreen trees, a frothing blue waterfall across the valley, a glowing yellow sun in the blue sky laced with puffy white clouds. I sat that way for a time, integrating the knowledge that I wasn't just of the Earth, that I was the Earth."
meditation,I was sitting and meditating when I realized that My body was fully relaxed. Almost to the extent that I could not and wished not to move it at all.
meditation,"(I have had several, increasingly clear and increasingly more complex experiences of relaxing my attention to be used freely by my ""ego"" while being aware as awareness.) (I have had this ""inquiry"" into why I cannot think thoughts properly when being aware as awareness.) (The practice I use is my own meditation practice I have combined from several sources. Thich Nhat Hanh has similar, but so do several others. I cannot express strongly enough how gently all is done (haha). I observe my breath. During breath in I do some combination of: relax - my body, ego_ feel/be world/sensations and just allow them_ and/or be curious. During breath out I connect with peace and joy_ slightly smile_ be compassionate towards myself/sensations/others/world_ and/or keep being curious.) (The language doesn't work well to describe this sort of experience. You could replace ""It was noted that"" with ""It happened that"". There is no witness, there is just the stuff of which experience is formed from. Also, word me means something akin to ego or construct. There is no way to describe everything as you'd like. The experience/memory is rich_ I just picked the core of the frozen memories of which/over which the story is built by the mind.) I was sitting in a squat at my school (studying for bachelor degree), just leaning to a wall. Sun was shining in and I was enjoying the warmth. I was listening to advaita teaching, but mainly I had in-ears on to block the voices around me. I was sitting there. I was doing my meditation practice while allowing thoughts to come and interrupt me. It was noted that me was thinking of noisy people 10 meters away. It was noted that there was sensation of slight tremor under the sternum (it was noted that there was interpretation of the sensation and location visualized for the sensation). It was noted that me was dualistically mindful of that. It was noted that me was annoyed as an interpretation. It was noted that me was also somehow knowing all this from perspective of just being while simultaneously being me. It was noted that me was wishing (a thought) the interruption (sensation) to go away (It was noted: a complex thought). It was noted that me was able to think and plan. It was noted that me wasn't able to think some other thought (now forgotten) - it just dissipated too fast. It was noted that there was/me had a certain sense of right to other thoughts and not towards some other thoughts . It was noted that me had an insight regarding sensation of sacred that could be used to discern what thoughts just belong."
meditation,
meditation,Was on beach relaxed breathing consciously looking out to see and experienced what I can only describe as a transcendental experience and felt I was being asked to make a positive commitment to follow a spiritual path. I remember thinking I choose. It was a very positive experience .
meditation,"I was on a seven day long zazen retreat and had been doing koan practice for several years. I didn't notice exactly when it happened, but at some point, probably around the third day of the retreat, I realized my experience of being had changed. There was walking, looking, hearing and thinking, but nobody that did those things. It was little bit like I was out of my body and mind, without any location where the awareness resided. And yet, at the same time there seemed to be very sharp and clear looking/awareness of all that. There was nothing to put identity on, and at the same time there was volitional acting happening. Still, no sense of any ""I"" using that volition. The experience was really intense, yet relaxed and natural at the same time. Seeing and hearing was intense, but the sounds and sight were not loud or disturbing. It was more like the act of looking was intense, but not the seeing, act of hearing was ""loud"", but not the sounds. The experience itself was really stable and continued whether I was sitting, walking, eating, going to toilet, dokusan, or whatever. I didn't have to support it in any ways. Then at some point, after two days, I realized the intensity had ceased, although some of that intense quality was noticeable for several months after that. (And this experience never ceased totally, as I can still notice it when I put my focus on it, no matter what I am doing.)"
meditation,"I awoke in the middle of the night with my consciousness 'in spate', roaring in some extraordinarily weird yet natural-seeming state, a ‘tuning’ or ‘gear’ in which my whole experience of consciousness, of being, was palpably, amazingly, different. I've not yet managed a verbal description which doesn't sound like a rather pathetic attempt to paint in known colours something of colours beyond them, and entail excessive use of inverted commas. To strive with the generally known assignments of the following words, then… In an intense, oceanically flowing, multiply resonant awakeness, my extra-vivid sensation of myself was as something inter-existing with the totality of everything, in a literally sensational experience of non-duality, of vibrant inter-embeddedness with a greater whole, something living, aware, dynamic, growing, boundless. This state lasted for some time – which I'd guess at perhaps 10-20 minutes – and in some lines I wrote whilst in it I tried to describe this all-consuming realisation, these direct sensations, of being in “a world of infinite immediate mystery”…. It was a total immersion, physically swimming and drinking in such waters as left nothing feeling like dry, solid land in terms of outer world or inner being. Entirely spontaneous (ie. not induced by drugs or directive actions but rather somehow arising from and/or despite the sum of inner residua from my experiences up to that point) it had much in its characteristics and physical ‘taste’ in common with experiences I’d awoken many times to somehow tune into, expand into, in the middle of the night as a child. Both were characterised by physical sensations ‘as per’ plenitude and infinitude – sensations of total expansiveness, of energetically expanding, of completely relaxed concentration and connectedness, with a phase or phases particularly focused on an especially striking amplification, intensification, of the sense of sound – in part like I could hear the air, or the blood moving in my ears, but more than that as if I could ‘hear myself listening’, as if the psychophysiological processes involved in listening itself were themselves heard loud and clear…. As I recall it now, my sense is that it was energy, imagination and direct perception weaving synergistically into and around each other in 'abnormally' high gear. To the best of my recollections a returning back to a more ordinary kind of consciousness went alongside my coming to struggle with descriptively capturing the experience in words as I put together the line “Here in this blood I may be carried through the bodies of any…”  (I was 28 when this happened.The childhood experiences referred to here to were periodic extremely freaky but profoundly fascinating spontaneous middle-of-night-time experiences of altered states of consciousness, as with my sense of identity/ energy/ body palpably expanding, filling the room and beyond. These took place between the ages of about 4 and 10.)"
meditation,"Not sure what you mean by ""The Experience"". Meditation brings many experiences, just like walking down a street does. While meditating, I frequently experience realizations about behavior, distractive nature of mental activity, grasping and aversion. Some of those ""experiences"" are profound, some are not."
meditation,"Found a video on YouTube about Dzogchen and watched it out of curiosity. I didn't know at the time, but the lama was pointing out the nature of mind. It was so utterly ordinary and simple yet it completely shifted my perception. I realized the mind was neither inside nor outside of the body and that thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, emerge and dissolve in that no-place of the mind without a trace. It established me in a state called Trekcho which means cutting through. The best way to describe it is effortless effortlessness. It is not autopilot because I am thoroughly aware but it's not willful volition because I'm not creating a narrative of doer and deed."
meditation,"I was on day eight of a Vipassana Satipatthana course. I was working with scanning sensations, doing the Vipassana technique. I started off very solidified (on day 3 when we started Vipassana) by day 7 I was mostly free flow, except for my hips, and tailbone, they had “gross sensations” everything else was just free flow sensation. When I sat for the last sit of the day the solidity was becoming free flow as I scanned. As it “melted” I scanned down into my feet and I couldn't distinguish a context, my feet were pure sensation and they felt as if they had dissolved. As I scanned upwards more of the confines of my body dissolved. I went from feeling like I was the one breathing to feeling like I was BEING Breathed. So difficult to put this into words. I felt my face disappear and for several minutes I lost the ability to know myself in the context of my body. After a few minutes I felt myself resolidify from head to toe. Although I felt like I had a different body then before, with different solidity. It’s been 11 days since this happened and I still feel different. It was an amazing and freeing experience."
meditation,"I was at a vipassana retreat, meditating while lying down in my room on the 5th day of the 10-day retreat. I was alone (my roommates were meditating in the meditation hall). As best as I can remember, I was having a pretty normal session. It was in the afternoon, and as I was doing a body scan, I suddenly started to feel an effervescence all over my body, as though I were dissolving or breaking apart into tiny bubbles. It was amazing, and I kind of just lived in that experience for a little while, and then it passed and I felt just back to meditating the way I had been prior to having that experience."
meditation,deep breathing released what felt like trauma in the body felt light rushing feeling things felt clear felt free of tenseness felt free of anxiety felt like a balloon almost as in light in weight felt i had no problems felt i had resolved problems felt like much freer and lighter could feel a more subtle energetic body during the process intense emotions and sensations occured and were experienced but we followed the speaker and moved through this discomfort with their guidance i didn't return to previous states before session i do this once a month this breathwork and its changing my life releasing all the trauma almost felt quite high like flying
meditation,"Trauma release, sudden fever without any other symptoms of being sick + body shaking and emotional reactions, and nausea. Emotional memories from specific situations that has happened a long time ago. I have been alone, but have had people present over the phone and such. However, over the course of many years I have had different kinds of experiences, not only once. Nothing magical"
meditation,"I was attending a yoga retreat abroad. Duration of the retreat was one week. We had yoga practice every morning and every evening. After 3-4 days of retreat I had this very significant experience. It happened during the asana practice in a shed outside in the nature. There were other yogis there, maybe 15-20 in total. I knew some of them and the rest I had just met in the retreat. There was our teacher leading the yoga practice. The whole practice is very meditative, we focus on the meditation and relaxation, not on the postures. After maybe one hour of practice, when we were coming slowly to the posterior part of the practice, I was in a deep meditation and I had some images. The first thing I saw was Ganesha, the elephant-headed god. After that I saw Saraswati with her veena, And the third thing I saw was a triangle with an eye inside it. Everything what I saw was very clear and colorful. It felt very significant. I knew that doing yoga and going on on this yoga path was what I wanted to do and what I needed to do. Although I was in deep meditation, I understood that Ganesha stands there for new beginnings, Saraswati for learning, and the triangle and eye are the god. So I knew that things were right. I was very impressed with the experience, and a little bit shocked too. It felt like a discussion with god, I felt connected and it was a proof to me that there is so much more to life, what we cannot see with our eyes. (After this experience the eye has become for me an important indicator: I see it often and when I see it I know that I am connected to the source, to god.)"
meditation,"Please write down everything you experienced during The Experience (what happened, where, who was present, thoughts, feelings, images, scenarios) as accurately and in as much detail as possible. Remember that every detail is important. It was a 12 day meditation retreat in thailand. The place was called wat suam mokkh. There was 70-100 participants. The year was 2007 january. I remember the exact day the experience took place, it as 6.1.2007 at daytime. The meditation style we practiced was called Anapanasati, it's the meditation style of theravada forest tradition. Thought by buddhadasa bhikku, and now by an english monk called dhammavidu. The experience transformed my life. I experienced more than a state of ecstasy, it was a state where i could understand what and how nature works, what energy is, and most of all what is the most inner essence of me and my consciousness. The experience lasted for three weeks before the mundane way of perceiving reality came back. Then i started my daily practice. But it took me many years to get my nervous system in balance and to learn and find a proper way to meditate so that i could keep my balance in city life and as a part of society. The experience is quite a scifi story, a classical enlightenment by deep meditation. After six days of meditation, after keeping the consciousness alert all the time, even when sleeping. Finally all my energy gathered into a single pointed concentration. Fatigue was gone, and the meditation was deep and sound. Then i focused on breathing, as i was instructed. I felt like flying in a wormhole, a huge amount of energy was shaking my body and i tried to stay concentrated on the middle. Finally the last thing that was causing the shaking and imbalance was my separate self. That realization shifted me perception of reality. Clouds went away from my mind, literally i saw clouds moving away before my eyes and a really bright star appeared. After the star a black tunnel sucked me inside. First towards me and then down. I feel my consciousness turned itself inside out, like going thru a event horizon of a black hole. I entered into an eternal space, where life and death happened simultaneously. I was still connected to my heart but i was given an opportunity to shift back to the cycle of life by dying. It felt like a possible choice to do, it was really 50/50 what to do. After spending an eternity in that space i decided to return back to my body. After 30 seconds my senses came back, first the sense of body, then hearing, then the mind came back . Before i opened my eyes i knew something has changed. When i opened my eyes, i saw this flux going everywhere. I felt like a huge amount of data was being transmitted into my body and mind. I could start to learn how to read energy, nature and minds of other people. The first thing i did was cry. Then i started to draw atoms in the sand. It's almost 16 years ago. But the memory is still very vivid and alive. I could still describe new details about the experiment. It didn't make me happy tho. It didn't give me tools how to stay in permanent relationships or knowledge how to prosper in the working life. But it did change me and it still is the most important shift in my life how i became the person who i am today."
meditation,"(I had been doing 1.5 hour self-made walking meditations for some years, focusing to what is observable and coming back whenever the mind distracts.) 27.12.1985, at the age of 25, I was walking outside and saw how the street light filters through empty branches. Suddenly the vision filled the mind, as if a bubble had bursted. The geometric patterns of the branches were impossible and unnecessary to know or control. There was only this moment and experiencing. The existential anxiety, the question about the observer observing itself, and the feeling of being an outsider were gone. Intellectual and verbal thinking were distant. The mind was filled with relief and certainty. I continued walking and enjoyed. (At that time I did not have any spiritual tradition, so I just continued ordinary life. The existential anxiety had permanently disappeared. The burning question was no more burning. Nine years later I started quite intensive zen training.)"
meditation,"I was on a week long silent meditation retreat, the second one that I've participated in, together with about eight other people including a teacher. As often happens on these retreats, as the days pass, an inner silence starts to develop and sensations become clear, focused and meaningful. Sounds, taste, visual impulses are clear and there's a tranquil beauty to the world. On the fifth day of the retreat, after breakfast, dishes and morning coffee, I went out for a walk in the forest. I noticed, already before I went out, an overwhelming inner silence, almost no thoughts were present and every little sound of the surroundings where bright and clear. As I walked on a forest road I suddenly had an experience of myself disappearing or dissolving into the experience of exactly what was happening. The feeling was that I was walking, my legs where moving, arms swinging, seeing the gravel on the road, the trees beside me, hearing every sound and so forth, but that there was no me, only the environment. Everything I perceived was the only thing that existed. I also felt a rush of energy through the body. It was like a feeling of the whole body being deeply alive. I walked back to the retreat center, did my work task and sat in meditation for about an hour, still with this sense of being without a central character. It ended with the rational thinking rushing in during sitting, starting to explain the experience in words to myself, the self that was returning along with the inner dialogue. I had a simultaneous sense of wonder at what had happened, but at the same time disappointment that the experience didn't last. The last two days of the retreat was like life as usual and I thought that maybe I had lost the connection. But when I returned home I felt a deep sense of wonder, love and curiosity that lasted for days. I took long walks just marveling at the simple fact that my body was moving. Little everyday sights in the streets had a great beauty to them. Inanimate object had the sense of being alive. People seemed extraordinarily friendly. The world felt meaningful and playful in the same way as it used to during childhood. As this faded into regular life, for about two months I still had a great sense of inner calm, love and belonging. I am still able to access the feeling of wonder. Meditation makes it more pronounced in everyday life, more often present, but in an everyday kind of way."
meditation,"During a guided 30 minutes online meditation session, which I weekly participate, I was sitting by myself before the screen, eyes closed, There was a felt sense starting from around the region of my heart, soft, open, expanding until the universe, warm light coming insight and love flows through every cell of my body."
meditation,"The experience opened my perception of the underlying substratum within myself. It revealed that I am that, the creator, the generator of all that is born, exists and dies, of creation, birth, the new and destruction, war, death and climate change. This I creates the climate disasters to make the Same I suffer of be destroyed. The largely unknown co-meditators fused with my person and there was no other, only a deep feeling of Connection, boundless Love and Compassion. Just one rhythmically pulsating Energy field was sensed beyond time, space and Form. No body, no mind, no Emotion, just Energy. After a while the experience retreated, leaving behind this intense wonder at existence. As is the manifest materializes in Order to reencounter the unmanifest. Like a dance, a web in which we live forever. The memory has stayed since Thun and the ability to enter awareness at will."
meditation,"Day 6 of the 10 day retreat. My 10th retreat like 6 years ago.  I was sitting the afternoon sit (45 minutes stints). Suddenly I just hooked off from my body and entered a vision where the sensual experiences were shown as energetic flows that didn't follow my body's outlines. I knew I was ""in it"", that I had dropped down to the thing itself, to the core, to the essence of reality. This has also happen many times since, but usually only in one aspect or another per time. The first time was like the most holistic.  I felt like I was only my skeletal structure that was really carried by the universe. The room, the retreatants and me have all disappeared and the space was extended. In the middle of this vast empty consciousness I did saw this 5-fold vertically layered entity that had energy flowing from layer to another, both ways. It was me. I was looking it all around of it. The energy was bright and water-like and it was dropping without effort both up and down. There were different colours associated with each layers (I later checked that eerily they did 80% match with classical chakra colours. I did not had back then or have now any great interest on chakras or energy-stuff). I also saw other similar entities far away. The distance was more like watching stars with telescope. This went on until the end of the session. It must have been over 30 minutes. No inner time consciousness during the experience. There was a room for thinking, but no willingness to do so. On the same night I woke up at night and started floating 30 centimeters up from my bed. In front of me was a buzzing yellow cloud of energy that was unknown force and its presence was all-pervasive. I was in total awe and couldn't do anything. No fear involved, although there was black vortexes piercing the sun like radiating entity. I was with this all more than 20 minutes, but I knew then that I need to go to toilet, or otherwise I will pee to the bed (I did know what was happening in the objective reality, that has also become a common feature on my dream practices). I wasn't happy I had to stop the experience, but I did made all the efforts (it wasn't easy) to get back to reality and get up. As I rose from the bed the entity vanished, I went to toilet and then came back. As I lay back down to bed, the entity came back as a flash and I floated up. I think I stayed there hours with it. However I did woke up to the morning bell from regular sleep and more refreshed I have ever been in my whole life. Next day I had a one-to-one interview with the teacher of the retreat and told him about the experience. He said I met the power of liberation, but I need more love. Lots of love. I guess I still do."
meditation,"I participated at a silent 10 day Vipassana retreat. There was a Vipassana master present but the meditations were guided my S.N.Goenka’s tapes. This was perhaps half way through the retreat, I do not recall the day exactly anymore. I was sitting on the floor of the meditation hall with my legs crossed, eyes closed, in a room full of people silently practicing one-pointedness, focusing on each individual point in our body with laser focus, advancing through the entire body. I felt the practice was easy, and going well. As we got the the area of the groin, I recall hesitating whether or not to focus on the genitals, but the instructions were clear: every single point in our body. As I moved my single focus on the clitoris, a very very strange phenomenon happened. I felt how my band has were activating, closing and tightening like a corset around my spine, and a red, fiery substance began to rise along my spine, as if it was mercury rising within a thermometer. I clearly saw the event taking place in my minds eye, and felt enormous pressure building up as the liquid stopped and pressure was rising in my lower body. I remember feeling alarmed, fighting against the pressure but while the sensation was scary, it was no unpleasant and I decided to surrender to it. As soon as I did, the substance burst through whatever the obstacle was, that was holding it down and rose a notch further up my spine, starting to build again. Now I knew what to do and relaxed into it. This went on until the substance reached my head and then suddenly it burst through the top of my head and i felt my entire body pulsating as the fiery liquid kept exiting through the top of my head, raining down all around me as if I was a fountain. Despite of my confusion and bewilderment I felt intense joy, bliss and the feeling was also quite sensual. This went on and on, and i remember getting a bit worried if it was not going to stop and wondering if others had noticed. I opened my eyes and the visual image disappeared and the activity stopped, and saw others in silent meditation around me, all was normal. As soon as I closed my eyes, everything continued. Eventually we came to a break time, and I got up and walked around outside in complete daze. I did not understand what had happened and in silent retreat I could not discuss this with anyone. There was something sexual about the experience and we had been instructed to not engage in anything the least bit sexual during the retreat, so I felt a bit ashamed- focusing on my genitalia was probably a mistake and I shouldn't have done it.. As the meditation resumed, and each time I closed my eyes, I would go back to the same phenomenon. Towards the end of the day I started to feel exhausted. The muscles on my torso were exhausted as the bad has were clenching them so tight. I started to feel it was all too much, and decided to force it to stop. And I managed to. I did not allow myself to go into the posture, to allow the bandhas to close, and I was able to control it. After the retreat I told my husband about it, but despite looking for I for I could not figure out what had happened and it was too bizarre - I felt I could not tell anyone else. (Two years later I was attending a yoga teacher training. During the training kundalini awakening was discussed and the description matched my experience exactly - I realized that was what had happened. The kundalini messed with my meditation practice for many years and I experienced other incredible phenomena, such as all my nadis being alive with electricity- I was electricity and saw myself as I had seen drawings of nadis shining in silver, it was amazing but also bizarre and scary.another few years on, an intuitive therapist & reiki master grounded my kundalini. It was another amazing experience as he was able to awaken the kundalini and helped me ground it. That had a tremendous effect on me, and I came to terms with the kundalini, and now regard it as a huge blessing. It is not two years since my kundalini was grounded and I have come a long was on the spiritual path I'm on. Without my kundalini awakening my life would be very different and my outlook on life has changed. There are great mysteries out there.)"
meditation,"I attended a 7-night vipassana meditation retreat in a beautiful setting with delicious food. I had sent an intention for the retreat: to face the grief that I had been carrying around for almost 25 years from losing my mother when I was 15. On the last morning of the retreat, as I sat in the silent lanai that we were using as our meditation hall, and I heard the exotic birds and smelled tropical flowers and the sound of the ocean, I fell into a deep state. I found myself reliving the moment in which I had my last conversation with my mother. I was 15 and standing next to her hospital bed in the ICU. She was squeezing my hand. My father stood just outside, fighting back tears, unable to face the sudden impending death of his 52-year-old wife. He told me it was time for us to go. I was confused because I knew we had nowhere else to be, but with my obedient nature, I began to pull away from my mom. She squeezed my hand without saying a word, as if to pull me back, to pull me closer to her, not wanting to die alone. I would walk away and carry that regret with me for 25 years. Only, this time, instead, she spoke. She said to me, ""I love you."" She would not have the human voice to say it to me ever again, but she wanted me to know and remember for the rest of my life that I was loved."
meditation,"I was a student, thus more than 25 years ago, and I started to practice yoga some 2-3 years before this experience. At the time of the experience, I was in love, but in a calm, deep manner. One day I just did some yoga practice at home, and when I executed the child's pose (yoga mudra), focusing on the heart area, as instructed in the yoga course. Usually, this pose would just bring me relaxation of the back area, and some state of peace. But at this one time, somehow I dived into an inner space that was extremely light and which was beyond time somehow. And I suddenly understood what it means to be eternal, even if we seem to be so defined by time and age, normally. It was amazing that this eternity was somehow in the present moment, now (I was not aware of mindfulness techniques or theory at that time). It seemed so natural, and logic, that it was just incredible that I missed this reality for so long, while it was just there, within reach (it felt like this then, but I could not repeat it a will_ I was also practicing rather randomly). I was melted in this space, and my mind seemed to have melted as well in something much bigger, expanding and containing way beyond my regular self. There were no thoughts, but rather observations of what I was experiencing. (When I returned to the regular state of mind I was extremely energized, and very centered in my heart. The state lasted in a residual form for hours, and even the days afterward I was under the impression of the respective state. Besides the joy of the experience, it also altered my relationship with time, knowing somehow that I AM no matter what.)"
meditation,"I was sitting alone on a small hill outside my country house far out in the northern archipelago of Stockholm. The sun was setting, it was a beautiful summer evening. I looked out over the sea and a small meadow with grass, stones and flowers. Suddenly my vision changed and I could to my great astonishment see a completely new landscape beneath as I transcended all and lost all sense of time and place. Everything was so clear_ the plants and stones showed completely new subtle qualities and colours, details I had never before observed, there was no distance between me and that, all was one boundless wholeness. I was filled with joy and gratefulness. As the sun later set under the horizon the vision faded and I went down to my house to make supper. (Comment: This experience completely changed my view on reality. Following this experience I started to make research, to understand what I had experienced. I learned about ""spiritual awakenings"", ""refined perception"" and other things that might fit my experience. This important experience was then followed by many others during the years to come, and I solely attribute them to my daily meditation practice. Many years later I resigned my work as an CEO to become a meditation teacher instead. )"
meditation,Lost sense of self.
meditation,"(The Experience occurred during part of my regular morning meditation practice, and the day after I had undertaken hypnosis to connect to a past life and the Life between Life dimension: https://paulaurand.com. At that time I typically meditated to binaural music recordings through headphones which are thought to aid in resonating brain waves on each side of the brain and to promote a deeper meditative experience: https://www.sacred acoustics.com.) In The Experience, I moved my mind through intention to join with my spirit guides and receive from them spiritual support and a possible message that would best serve my interests at that time. I could not ""see"" the guides and knew of their presence through feeling their energy. They, four of them, moved in to surround me very close, as though we were in a pod of some kind, and we began to spin very slowly, gradually increasing in speed as I sensed we were lifted off and were moving through dark space. In the distance I became aware of a light, and we were moving toward it. We slowed down as we got closer and moved up to it and then moved into it. Suddenly I became aware that we all had merged into the light, that we in fact became the light. I had never felt anything like it in my life. It was not that we felt very ""together"" or ""extremely close,"" or were ""with"" the light, it was that we literally were the same entity. We were not distinct from each other in any way. We were the light. I felt carried into this experience by a power beyond my control, that there was no ""my"" or ""me"" anymore but rather the sense that we, my guides and I, were one and the same as the light. The sensation was powerful, like the helplessness of being carried into and through a physical orgasm, except it was a spiritual experience and in no way physical. The sensation lasted mere seconds, and my guides and I separated from the light back into the ""pod"" and returned to our departure point (or what I had thought of as our departure point). I was profoundly changed by this experience, feeling a unity with the universe I had never experienced, and up to that time in my spiritual development had not really known was ""a thing,"" or was possible. I will never forget it, nor what that brief feeling of unity ever since has held out as a potential for me, for all of us in fact, after the division and separateness of our time in this physical dimension is over. The experience has not been repeated in meditation."
meditation,"I was meditating with a group of individuals and was quite deep. Clear as clear I heard a voice in my head exclaim in question, “a red eye?” After the meditation, as was custom, we would go around the room and share experiences as we chose. When one individual shared, she asked, “what does it mean if you see a red eye?” Well, that was pretty amazing and I got goosebumps. I didn't say a thing because at the time I felt like if I said, “hey I heard you say that!” that it wouldn't be believed. Freaky - and what are the odds of that? I write about this experience and others in my book entitled ""One Clumsy Seeker"" by Providence Greenseed."
meditation,"I was attending a one-week professional training in the use of therapeutic sound and shamanic practices. It was the morning of the third full day of the retreat, and our group of about 20 students had been in class for several hours already. There was a practice offered - I don't recall the proper ceremonial name - which was led by the two facilitators, who were using a variety of sound tools - bowls, chimes, drums, rattles, bells - along with their voices and chant.  Following the spoken guidance of the facilitator, at some point in the meditation I became aware that I was in a completely different space/place. I was in a very bright, comfortable space and although I could still hear the sounds in the room - had no awareness of my body, the space, or anybody in the room. The feeling was of being surrounded by and infused with an overwhelming sense of unconditional love, and then I heard ""Welcome home"". I felt suspended in this space, no need to move or to find more information, or to understand where the voice came from or why I didn't have a body.  When the practice ended, everyone else quietly got up from their cushions and left the practice room for lunch. I was aware of the room around me, and the quiet activity, and also of the separate beautiful space I was in. I felt no urgency to return to the room and may have sat for another 30 or 40 minutes before letting the experience go.  When I finally moved off the cushion and left the practice room I didn't feel able to relate to anyone, and went to my room to lie down for a while. A friend checked on me eventually, and by that time I was able to speak and just say that I was fine, and felt ecstatic - a feeling which stayed with me for many days.  (I do not have any memory of feeling unconditionally loved before or since that experience, but I know that I am. I know that I am an intrinsic part of a much larger universe or cosmos.)"
meditation,"20180419 prc Riverton 2_2 Union AgapeSchoolinz Meditation 09:20 ^We come on this occasion in order to continue the dialogue. We have as our perspective that of the coming into physicality, projecting our identity and ideas into this domain which you call yours. It is ours also, for we have been here. That it is not our residence in physical terms is a product of our ascension, to use that language. But more particularly and more accurately, of the conclusion of the round of lives of each of our once-parts, yet now union. This give us no better perspective, it could be argued, than any alive person, for the period of our occupancy concluded [and there seems to be no applicable time]. Nevertheless our oversight is such as to contribute to its state of currency in world affairs, as well as those of any inhabitant present or past that we choose to inspect. And so having inspected in this instance yourself, the recognition is that of the variety of choices for whom best to communicate through, this example is as good as any and better than most. The choice is not without its costs, for the risk of exciting animosity, self-will, egocentric bias, cult formation, are recognised by us and declined. Therefore it has required many years of training and, for this individual in particular, a denial of benefit of such vices, voyeurism, personality-level inclinations so as to nullify each of those aforementioned difficulties. For they could become so and they have become so at other times and places, as history attests. And so we have the dual purpose of both fostering a dependent relationship and yet also autonomy. And by agreement, we continue. The risk of exciting false claims or questionable claims to authenticity are such as to create in us a caution and minimal disturbance of such excitatory responses as remain. And the passive nature of this individual is one of its assets and best qualities. The circumstances by which such passivity is created has its roots in the past and we have facilitated exploration of those at other times. So the theme of bringing to light tendencies acquired and forgone by salutary lessons, as they could be viewed, provides a context by which we can have some confidence that the eventual discussion concerning this case will remain more positive than otherwise. [pause while inspecting surroundings] It is still true that those on the left are invisibly distant and disconnected – radically so. Therefore there need be zero concern of contamination within this location and context. We would now proceed to address the next level of the reason for our presence here today. [pause. And I thought to do an aura cleansing.] And the aura cleansing having been completed. [pause. I had thought the identity faint, so I sought to get close] The sunshine on the eyelids (indirectly refracted through a coarse cotton curtain) is a suitable representation of our domain of existence. Suffused by a golden light and a serene goodwill, we fit the description of traditional sources because they are not wrong. Having thereby established our credentials, we may continue. And to those whom such things matter, we can merely say “welcome.” And to those to whom such things are suspect, we can merely say “Wait. Withhold suspicion and come to understanding in your own time. And if not in this incarnation then in another.” [pause] And so now that you are within us, see the tranquillity. And there was a prior example and it was interpreted to be Guan Yin. There is only one Guan Yin and we are not it. And yet the quality of immersion of lower mind within the higher identity is very similar. We will not claim it to be identical because it is not. And yet the qualities of absorbance in benign non-judgemental loving inclusiveness are no different. This is a reminder of the state of Grace. That traditional term does not suffice, exactly because it connotes divinity. We would say, extract divinity and union remains. It is rare, certainly. It is memorable, certainly. It is acquired ecstasy, certainly. There is no necessity to exaggerate it with the idea of the connotations assembled around the concept of divinity. There is nurturance. There is positive regard. There is willingness to support. There is absence of time as a condition on such nurturance and support. To that degree, eternity is an applicable descriptor. Acceptance of every aspect (and) tendency enacted or not, which in psychological language implies both self and shadow. And we specify in every life endured, proclaimed or denied. And yet this is not special. It is merely the affection most commonly rendered by every mother to its newborn child. And yet there is no admonishment possible. But rather, infinite goodwill. And the term infinite on this occasion comprising unlimited extent in both time and degree, with compassion for the likely impacts of each life plan and respect for the boldness inherent in every decision to embark upon the physical journey into the crucible of tempest and conflict endemic in human life. [pause] This union is a rare experience for the embodied human, conditioned as it is by conditional acceptance and dismissal inherent in primal reactivity and competition of the embodied life. It is encountered in utero if stress is low in the circumstances of the mother. It is rarely encountered thereafter, unless in particularly positive maternal relationship or the replication of that in loving partnership. Nevertheless the expectations upon the adult human are such as to require sufficient alertness for external threat that it is seldom achieved unaided. And this is merely appropriate to the (physical) domain. In this condition at this present moment of this experience – isolated, protected by safe enclosure, supported by all the necessities for survival, conditioned by a few days of preparation, well-rested, and not in need of any thing, that sense of being in the centre and surrounded by love is available by special arrangement. And so it is in this moment. And so that rarity is a primary basis for the creation of the idea and the concept of divinity. Where there is hunger for such a state, that idea becomes supremely attractive because of the contrast between the normal life whereby such hunger is not responded to, or response to it is unavailable, that the promise of such magnitude triggers the indwelling hunger. And so the superlatives are utilised, because nothing else suffices to describe the difference between such a state and the demands of the ordinary life and its common spectrum of emotion. However, the superlatives are not justified if they are utilised to advertise. If they are utilised to describe, they are merely accurate to illustrate the distinction between the emotional spectrum of the ordinary life and the emotional spectrum of this particular state, and the narrowed spectrum of emotion concentrated on love. And so to view it in terms of emotional spectrum, predicated on the absence of survival issues and the variety of emotions necessarily associated with those concerns, is to reveal the condition by which on a topographic surface, there is a prominent impulse centred on the concept of love (shining in bright gold as if a spire or column or signal on a 3D map or cartography of diverse emotion). And so with the experience complete, we withdraw. P One could summarise that experience as comprising the bliss of union, I think. Very special! A singular experience. It’s funny, the sunlight looks (dim and wan,) distinctly lacking in that feeling of gold (brightly shining). No wonder gold metal is highly valued. Goodness me, that’s 43 minutes. That’s very similar to the Guan Yin experience. I'm a bit reluctant to let go of it. It’s definitely made my day! I'll rest a while before transcribing this, I think.

meditation,"I had left my home, marriage and I was broken open at the time and went North to Washington State to stay with friends ( a couple I had known since I was 20 and living in England ). I was very broken and had been trying to leave for a while as the situation was really abusive. I do not drink nor use substances but my husband was drinking a lot and he was a mean drunk. He was also very stressed and cantankerous. So I took one suitcase and our dog and car and drove north to be safe. I had tried to talk to his son and cousin about rehab for him and care his son was against it and his cousin a therapist said we all needed to be in on it. I left because I alone was in the line of fire and our dog was hiding behind the toilet every day and night in fear. I stayed with friends for 4 months and worked . when I could I rented an apartment without furniture but was given items by them and their friends. Then I would sit in silence in the empty room and meditate. I heard a woman's voice, very loving and caring and I was astonished. I did not see her but I felt her. It was her voice that was so calming and I thought God was always our mother so this was confirmation of that belief. She calmed me and I knew that I would heal from this and that I was going to be broken open from this day forward. I have never stopped hearing her after this I commune with her and I began to understand we are never alone and we are spirit and are one with everything in this entanglement like Indra's Net suggests. I learned to meditate using sanskrit and Om Ma ni padre hum. I chant the gayatri mantra many times daily and now I use Sufi healing and a mantra from this also. This calms any anxiety and I feel cleansed after I also use Tikkun Olam ( Heal the world ) as a Blessing. These ancient traditions in a Multi faith aspect are helpful as I feel at one while I am silent in meditation. I experience an altered state without any drugs. Silence is how I begin then I chant then She may or may not arrive so I use the breath to be at one with her. The feminine face of God or The Mother is how she come to me and it really began during my early childhood which is how I survived because the safest place in my childhood was outside the home. No surprise for many girls really, sometimes the only Mother who protects us is The Divine. I had help from this PTSD but no medication from a wonderful therapist in Wa. state when it surfaced after I left my home. I lost a lot but I gained this amazing ability to one-ing which has been with me since 2016. It is a mystical experience which has continued. I feel very calm and open to all possibilities and really free to be in this world of suffering and can navigate well. It has been a pilgrimage and I am on this path for the rest of my days here . I find new ways to navigate and fear is no longer acute or even present even when things are challenging. I have overcome much and I feel deeply present and able in this time which is a bit chaotic . I am changed forever , by my experience."
meditation,"A transformative phase in my life started when I focused my meditation on “Who am I?”. I remembered situations when people had hurt me and when I had hurt others. It was painful to experience the pain I had inflicted upon others. This dialectical process was followed by deeper relaxation during meditation. Eventually, I felt a very pleasant wordless calling or longing. One morning my world became totally still. I don't know for how long the experience continued. An absolute stillness and natural primordial state to rest in. It was as if an emptiness was marinated in warm acceptance. Afterwards, I realized that the absolute stillness was extraordinary and something I never had experienced before. A stunning insight that enabled me to realise that 'All is One'. I can't name a trigger. I just had my usual morning meditation, completely relaxed with an empty and clear awareness. When the clock rang, I continued as if nothing had happened. But it had. It was as if a very personal, yet non-personal and primordial state of being or egolessness existed at the same time. Meister Eckhart (1260-1328) calls the process to meet God as Isness, which is a good word for the consciousness I found twenty years ago. It just is. Nothing was inclusive or exclusive. Intensive and focused, yet limitless. More of a whole body-mind than a sensory experience without emotional and cognitive content. The insight “All-is-One” came after the experience. The first, second and third person didn't exist during my experience. It was something else, yet familiar. It was just ""isness""."
psychedelics,"I was in my friends' apartment when we took lsd, let's say fairly average amount, around 150 micrograms. The first hour we couldn't we anything, which was expected. We read a lot of experiences from recreational users so we know that the substance takes a lot of time to kick in. We listened music and chatted. After we started to see minor hallucinations and the walls kinda started to vibrate we went outside for a walk. The effect was getting stronger but we never felt anxiety or anything bad feelings. While we were walking around, the streetlight were brighter than usually and we felt like we were moving very slowly even though we walked normal pace. I think this was due to the hallucination-like vision. None of us had strong hallucinations but everyone did have some kind of vision changes. All the colours felt deeper and i had a feeling like a was walking in a cartoon. At the peak of the effect it started to rain but we just embraced it and listened to edm music. Overall the experience was one of the best nights with the boys. We did the same thing many times after this and i'm hoping to get a change to do that again in the future. Now everyone is studying or working so we don't find the time for these situations because it takes a bit more planning and preparing compared to a normal night out."
psychedelics,You mean the very last experience? I took some ketamine and have experienced state of dissociation of the body from consciousnesses or vice versa. I helped me to cope with some stressful emotions and resolve conflict in my personal life simply through talking it over with my partner. Also it gave me great deal of inside some nice business project idea and I had an absolutely fantastic sex. The experience gave me a much needed break in my work and lifeflow once I have started to loose it due to overwork and low self-esteem. Now it's a little bit of fresh air but a new chapter of my life with all its challenges is yet to come.
psychedelics,After first time of eating mushrooms I get away of depression. Ayahuasca helps me to find joy of life.
psychedelics,I was with a few close friends. We took some shrooms had a nice walk around town. Found ourselves in a park with a quiet spot by the water. We lied down there and watched the clouds. In that moment I could see how the cloud and sky are connected with each other and how the whole universe is interconnected. It gave me sensation that we are part of something bigger.
psychedelics,"As many other testimonials, i experienced a connection with nature, in particular with the plants around me. I also felt classical music very intensely. I thought of my beloved ones. * I accepted evil in the world.* I was able to think with more perspective (or something like that). I also felt that merely existing , of things and myself, was something impressive. I relaxed my expectations maybe, but i felt i understood better the meaning of life. Again, acceptance was a key element in my new way of looking at everything. It gave me relief, peace of mind, etc.  I felt quite anxious both times, a bit of a bad trip too."
psychedelics,"At first I felt the effect coming on, like 'someone' tiptoeing around my brain. I saw some colored fractals. I was laying on a mattress and my body was jerking / twitching (this didn't bother me much since I had had these twitches / jerks in my psychotherapy when processing traumatic events).  The music started bothering me, it felt loud and 'mystic' in a bad way. I chose to go outside and lay down in the grass. The twitching intensified, at this point it felt neither good or bad, everything just 'was'. After a while a facilitator came to me and said ""See if those twitches you have want to tell you something. Everything is welcome here"".  Then the twitches turned in to a release of emotions (it was not connected to the actual memory but I knew I was releasing the raw emotions that I couldn't bear / survive when I was drugged and raped by a relative as 11 years old.) I screamed and howled, and felt un excruciating mental pain: the pain of being abandoned by the world as a child, the loneliness in that, the complete pointlessness of it all. It just flooded out of me for about an hour. It was ugly and painful but it was also beautiful, as I had a facilitator by my side, gently stroking my back and talking to me. I have never felt so safe in my life.  I was very aware during this, aware that this would not have been possible in therapy, aware that my 'window of tolerance' was wide open, aware that even if it was very very painful, I needed this and it was healing. I was also aware that my experience didn't have much of 'psychedelics' to it (ie, no mystery, no visuals except for a short time in the beginning). When looking at people they were a bit distorted but I didn't look much at people when I was laying in the grass screaming, crying and howling (loud!). At one point I became concerned that maybe I was just hallucinating this happening since I had taken psilocybin so I asked the facilitator ""Is this really happening?"" to which he replied ""It depends on what you men by 'really', but yes, we are here, this is happening"". I felt very comforted by that because my thought was that going through this pain would be really pointless if it wasn't real. It was very physical and exhausting as my body would convulse with the screams. After a while I started to feel angry, there was so much anger beneath that pain, and I said to the facilitator that I wanted to hit someone. Hi suggested I hit the ground, I tried but by then I was so exhausted physically that I couldn't put much force to it. I realised I didn't have the energy to do more of this, and then I just went into a relaxed state, sobbing quietly, listening to the birds. A while later another facilitator came out and played the guitar, I sat up and felt in love with the world, with the music, with everyone. The thought of having been born came to mind.  I knew I was healed in some profound ways, but also that a part of the healing came from being so safely held by a facilitator during the experience. I felt happy, and very grateful. Then I felt the effect of the psilocybin was wearing off, and I just waited, happily, for a couple of hours, I think, to the ceremony to end. (After the experience several of my symptoms of Complex PTSD had disappeared, and they haven't returned)."
psychedelics,"Vaporized some 5-meo dmt at my friends cottage. Feeling was super intense. I fell into fractal world. I was sitting on couch and closed my eyes. Last thing I was able to say was ""this feels very inten..."" then vaporizer fell out my hand to lap. I was relieved to feel that my friend picked the vaporizer from my lap. For a second I was scared because of intensity but then I basically just let go. I was not existing anymore. I had no feelings, no sense of smell or hearing. Just fractal visualizations. Then I met god. It was green fractal serpent that was flashing through my vision on top of blackness. It was made of pure energy. Then I started to feel my senses coming back to me. First I realized I must be alive because I can see. I watched my hands and realized I can move them though they didn't yet feel like my hands. Then I laid on the couch for a while to think what did I actually went through. The experience lasted around 15 min."
psychedelics,"I was introduced to the realm of spirit. I had always known it was there, even as a very small child, but the cactus confirmed it to me. This alone was huge, because I had never known whether I was just overly imaginative. I also received a physical healing from chronic inflammation, and on the day of the medicine was able to walk all day, where for the previous 3 years the most I could manage was around 30 minutes (I had broken my tibia in two places 3 years earlier and had been plagued by bursitis in my hip since recovering from surgery. The bursitis didn't return for five years, and was put back in its place with a large dose of LSD). I was able to see, with open eyes, the spirit of the clouds and mountains where I was staying. It was the first time I had spent an entire day without any negative thoughts in as long as I could remember. The experience lasted around 14 hours."
psychedelics,"I kept a journal of my experience to best of my ability. At 17:00 I ate 17 fresh mushrooms, approx. 6 grams. I started doing some programming, waiting for something to happen. Started feeling slightly nauseous, the mushrooms tasted like dirt and black pepper. At 17:30 I felt strange flashes of quickly moving forward without moving. I went to lie on the floor and listen to peaceful music. At 17:45 I notice my pupils were extremely dilated.  At 18:00 I had not felt strong effects so I ate another 6 gram batch of mushrooms. I was having trouble concentrating and writing. My handwriting looks slightly scrambled at this point. Text on the notebook was moving and rising out of the paper. Square pattern of the notebook was moving. At 18:06 I decided to eat everything I had and ate the remaining approx. 8 grams of fresh mushrooms for a total dose of 60 mushrooms, 20 grams. I was seeing colors at the edges of my vision. The square pattern looked alive and was moving. I felt strangely peaceful but frightened of what was happening like it was not happening to me but someone else. 18:14 I went to the bathroom. My face looked strange, like someone else. It looked like something was moving under my skin. I closed my eyes while sitting on the toilet and saw sawtooth-shaped snakes moving across my vision. When I looked at the mirror and closed my eyes I saw a flash of a creature that looked like a human or a lingering image of myself. Its proportions were exaggerated and neon-colored, big eyes and ears. Like a mesoamerican god or something. I left the bathroom unsure what to think. I was experiencing time dilation and seeing shapes and colors when I closed my eyes. I remember sitting at my computer telling my friends of what was happening, and when turning around I saw a black-and-red, V-shaped thing rushing towards me, cutting my field of view in half. I was not scared of it however. At this point I must have fallen into a trance as I have no recollection or notes. I have no notes until 19:57 where I wrote ""I've returned from somewhere"". I do remember some visions from my trance. Between 18:14 and 19:57 I experienced extreme time dilation, or ""moments of eternity"" as I've seen them called. I would fall into a dreams and they felt immeasurably long. It was both incredible and horrifying. I would look at my watch and only a minute would have passed where I felt like hours.  I remember a few distinct visions from the dreams I had. -The first one was a kaleidoscope-like image of branches of a tree that folded on themselves against a turquoise background. -The second vision was of an ocean of swirling green and yellow fractals, with two-legged giant creatures marching through it in lockstep, with streams of the ocean rising up along their legs toward their heads. They had some sort of trunks, like elephants, and they were trumpeting together but I do not remember what it sounded like. -My third vision was of bright-pink axolotl-like creatures curling around each other, moving as a pillar across my field of view seemingly sprouting from each other and nothing. They had black dot like eyes and smiling mouths. I felt they were good, and somehow knew they were called ""first-creatures"" or something similar, as in they were the beginning of everything. -Fourth vision was of something that looked like a tropical forest with large-leaved trees. The trees flowed like water, and I remember hearing the sound of running water. The vision reminds me now of Dali's clocks. -Fifth vision was of a endless stream of color to which I would fall. These visions is where I remember experiencing the moments of eternity. I would nod in an out of them while lying on the floor. During the intense psychedelic part of 18:14-19:57 I remember feeling intense terror at least once and wanting to wake up from the experience, begging for it to be over. I was trying to hold on to the carpet like I was speeding through space. I kept reassuring myself that I ""could not fool them"" and I had to surrender to the dream. By ""them"" I mean what I perceived as masters or gods of the mushroom trance, and that their punishment would be merciless if I allowed myself to come apart and fail their test. I felt like I had scales or feathers on my back that fluttered due to the fear I felt, and when I defeated the fear and surrendered to the experience the feeling dissipated. One thing that helped me calm down was to hang on to good thoughts like how much I loved my wife. I sent her a voice message telling her this. As written above, 19:57 is where I felt I returned from somewhere, likely the intense psychedelic part. This is where the visions stopped and some sort of psychological trip continued. I experienced some sort of dissociation or similar, and have no memory between approx. 20:00 and 20:20. During this time I video called my wife and around 20:20 I remember squatting on the floor looking at my wife on the phone. My wife told me that we had talked normally, but now I was acting strange. I looked paranoid and kept looking around quickly. I remember putting a piece of paper on the door of my room reminding myself to not go outside, but the paper was gone. It was on the doorknob, and I think I took it off while going to the toilet at some point. I remember seeing my phone hand swirling with brown or golden vortexes as well as my wife's face on the phone screen. Like the google deep dream that turns everything into dog faces. I remember my wife being looking concerned and myself feeling sad that I could not reassure her that everything was ok. I felt like I did not know how to talk. I eventually told her that I felt like I still had to finish my journey and we ended the call. I also said I was sorry for calling since it made her worried and I had no way of reassuring her. My wife was mildly amused. I think I called my wife a couple of times over the experience. She was initially against me trying psychedelics and is still apprehensive. I remember feeling guilty for doing what I did. I also felt extreme longing toward her. I am currently in a different country from her for an extended time. At 20:30 or so after the call, the experience was winding down. I felt very tired and was lying on the bed. I did not remember going there. The walls were moving and I was listening to peaceful music. It felt like I had gone through the most intense experience of my life. I was writing down my memories of what had happened. I almost called my sister but did not. I also saw that I ate all my snacks, which were fruits and berries. The walls looked like they were breathing, and a painting on the wall seemed alive. The trees in it looked like they were radiating light. I tried writing down as much as possible to the notebook about what I remember while waiting for the experience to end completely. I checked my phone records and saw that I had called my wife at 19:11. My wife told me that I had talked of seeing forbidden things. I believe this was referring to the second vision. I wrote many times that I missed my wife intensely. I also remember doing strange things like flossing my teeth, believing I was about to go to bed. I would find myself in a different part of the room without realizing I had moved. At 21:54 I wrote that the visual effects had ended. I went to make pasta and ate it. I went to bed at 00:10, but have no notes or memory of what happened."
psychedelics,Met some helpful and kind spirits for a very short time. I am a not a spiritual person but they were from the spirit world.
psychedelics,"The experience was initially very gentle and loving. Then it became very profound, giving love and tenderness to the parts of me that had been hurt, challenged and relatively unavailable for sometime. I was able to articulate with more of me available and less reactivity, ultimately alleviating a lot of accumulated nervous system burden . I felt deeply again ."
psychedelics,"I felt my ego melt away. Then, for a flash of a second, i felt the sorrow and grief of all the humans in the world. I cried and cried at the pain. Then, as psychedelics are prone to, i felt the love and happiness of all the humans in the world."
psychedelics,"I layed down in a bed in my friends summer cottage. I listened to Johns Hopkins university’s psilocybin research playlist on Spotify. The music sounded sometimes dark, sometimes odd, sometimes full of joy and beauty. When I closed my eyes, I felt huge wave of love and happiness and I had a huge realization that ”The good guys will eventually win in the world and as I'm a good guy, I just need to do my thing and be patient. Everything will be ok eventually”. Then I saw a totem pole in my mind. The pole consisted of the faces of three of my friends. Each friend was representing some positive personal trait I could learn from them: patience, perseverance and positivity and physical wellbeing.  At some point the music became too intense and I had to take my headphones off. Almost immediately I felt like I was launched to the orbit with a rocket. I decided to fully surrender to the experience. As i layed down in the bed I felt like gravity was shifting. I knew the bed was level, but still something was pulling my body towards one corner of the bed. Next my body began to cramp heavily. I resisted the urge to fight back and surrendered. I felt the cramps squeezed me flat against the bed and realized what it felt like to be a two dimensional character. Next i began to feel extremely intensive feelings. Extreme joy and happiness resulting tears of joy. Sadness and grief with hopeless sobbing. Next i felt that my body began to be warm and tingly. Tingling sensation filled my body and at the same time a strong anger raised. I growled aloud and i was squeezing the bed with my hands. I felt that the anger was flowing off from me. The rest of the experience I cannot recall."
psychedelics,"I took my 6 grams, powdered and infused with lemon juice. Within 25 minutes i was feeling contact with the medicine. A blue span of vision opened up before me and a group of people were walking towards me. When they got close and clear enough to see, i could see that it was Jesus Christ, Buddha, Shiva, Mohammed and just about all of the deities both familiar and unfamiliar. I felt very humbled and i prostrated myself and they told me ""NO! This is for you. We bow to you tonight."" I started crying, feeling totally unqualified and undeserving of this reward. I had helped a lady that i didn't know earlier that day and it was coming back around. It showed me that because i care so much about not only people but plants and animals as well, that's why i was receiving this reward. I tried to tell ""it"" that i didn't deserve this treatment and it insisted that i did? I spent the next 3-5 hours in meditation and honor. It was the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me."
psychedelics,"I am currently 52 years old. There have been many positive psychedelic experiences with mushrooms, self and most recently smoked dmt. The experience described happened when I was 17. I was already experienced with lsd so this experience did not happen my first time.  It can be labeled as a classic bad trip. For me this happens when an experience shifts from looking outward, enjoying the visuals and turns inward. Your mind starts to focus on you, the negative aspects. it is like stepping outside yourself and viewing yourself as from an outsider's perspective. On this one particular night, this happened, and it was not the first time or the last. I grew up with two older brothers. I was physically and psychologically bullied from a very young age. Which led to me having a quick temper and fighting more than average. Also, I had done some petty criminal activity by this time of 17, rare and nothing extremely violent in nature. So, during this episode I saw that my actions, if continued, would lead me down a path that would perhaps lead me to being in jail at some point. I also saw for the first time that my actions had been shaped by me being bullied by my brothers and I was lashing out at the world because I was too young to lash out at them. The experience was very psychologically difficult, self-loathing and depressing. But from that day forward I have worked on my temper. I did not do any petty crimes. Since that time the only physical fights I have gotten into were with my brothers. Several times in the past a verbal disagreement was escalated by them and as soon as they poked my chest or pushed me, I fought back. This happened maybe 4 times , from then till now. Now I am patient, try not to stress about things, not violent, try to help people if I am able to. There are two things which make my blood pressure rise. Traffic or bad drivers tailgating me and if someone is rude to me. The ladder has caused me to lose my cool maybe once every five years, to the point I may yell at someone. But I credit me turning my life around from that one particular experience. An lsd bad trip"
psychedelics,"I used LSD pretty often, maybe once a week, and it was kind of my project. I was reading about it and opening my brain to the universe, as Aldous Huxley said. Anyway, I had experienced “crazier” trips, but this one was it. When I knew. Knew knew. I don't know if I can explain this knowledge, but people who know know. I could feel the music inside my body, hear nature, hear my veins and vibration in the air. I felt like I could see, hear and feel for the first time. I was lying on the balcony and looking upwards and flying to the stars: darkness, weird sounds, and just me. of my trips are filled with my experiences, with stuff I read, listen to and wish. So it’s neverending searching for me."
psychedelics,We had lot of fun walking in nature felt like friends for life
psychedelics,"There were too much things on my mind, that i can talk about it all day, but i haven't too much time, sorry"
psychedelics,"Because I have met the big spirit more times I could only say, that these ceremonies absolutely changed my life. Before it the life was about suffering. Now it is about enjoying and the quality is absolutely higher. What I have met during sessions? I died about 20x, I discover a lot of parts of me and healed a lot of relations. So great healing. Aho mytaque oyasin"
psychedelics,"I went in to this experience expecting a fairly moderate trip with some pretty closed-eye visuals, the person who provided it to me said the effects were subtle but very pleasant. I weighed out 30mg (after hearing that the effects seem quite gentle even at higher doses), put it in some tissue paper and swallowed that with a drink. I wasn't apprehensive at all, and was open-minded as to what to expect from the experience. At the time I had been experimenting with a variety of ""research chemicals"", and i was also fairly new to drugs in general_ so I was getting used to going into an experience not knowing what to expect. I've never saved a copy of the trip report so don't remember many details from the come-up or the majority of the trip apart from ""The experience"". Around half-way through the experience I found myself laying on my bedroom floor gazing up at the lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.  With my eyes open I was aware of who and where I was a 20 year old student tripping on the floor of my dorm room in England. With my eyes closed I was a completely different individual, a model on a photoshoot at a beach somewhere in california. Both lives felt equally real, and at one point i asked myself ""But who am I then?"".  I had the notion that a name is just something given to us at birth, and our identity is something which develops via life experiences. We have no real choice over ""who"" we are. Suddenly it felt as though i ""fell out"" of both identities into a void. I am nothing, I just am. I am. I realised that the thing we commonly identify with is just the ""ego"". A suit of clothes we're born in to. When we take that suit off, we're all just one present moment of consciousness. Everything and Nothing are the same Thing. After the trip i felt completely free and just as connected to inanimate objects as to my blood relatives or close friends. Suddenly my political beliefs, likes, dislikes and opinions were just ""pins"" or ""badges"" i was wearing on the suit of clothes which was my ""ego-self"" this self felt completely illusory. Music and other things i once related to lost their emotive power over me and i found experiencing ""the pure present moment"" just as interesting and enjoyable as engaging in any other activity. I felt i was experiencing ""true reality"" without any personal bias. This feeling of freedom was emotional, psychological and physical. I felt as though something was holding my weight from above as I walked around, almost as though i was floating. This feeling persisted for a week or 2. I went to seek advice from the local Buddhist centre as I realised this was an ""ego death"" experience and didn't feel like i had anywhere to turn to, or anybody who'd understand. At the buddhist centre the monk said i may have had ""the experience"" but now it was time to do ""the paperwork"". At the time i didn't understand what he meant as it felt like everything was complete. As time went on I ""slid back"" into my old ego-self, with many of the same thoughts, feelings, and emotions as before. However, now I was more aware of how much unnecessary discomfort I was causing myself when dwelling on these things. I became more interested in personal-development and mental health during the following months, and once I finished my undergraduate degree in Film Production a year later, i decided i'd like to pursue a career in something related to Mental Health / Psychotherapy instead. As time went on my anxieties and neurosis returned over the years and I started to realise what the monk meant by ""doing the paperwork"". I found myself holding on to ""the experience"" rather than just living by the lessons gained from it.  Having this experience so early in life, before I had any idea of what I actually wanted to do in the future, did lead me down some nihilistic and self-destructive paths. I started using (and abusing) harder drugs, and went through periods of feeling completely lost.  That being said, no matter how ""lost"" I became i'd always have some kind of reminder or memory of the oneness and freedom which underpins all things. As time went on I done more self-work, through therapy, psychedelics, and trying to find meaning through voluntary work / helping others. I realised the periods of darkness I went through following ""the experience"" were actually valuable lessons, and the initial feeling of ""realising the ultimate truth"" was actually only the beginning of my journey."
psychedelics,"I was home alone knowing my fiance come home soon after the trip. The day and day after was vacation. Some classical or ecm-jazz was playing from my stereos. I always make about 5h playlist to play when I trippin with mushrooms. Trips first half was emotional purification. Restless and quite hard. Lots of walking and feeling. Then after 1,5-2h tripping it calm and I was able to sit down and relaxing and next few hours I was balanced and spacious state of consciousness."
psychedelics,"Sorry to not have the bandwidth to describe this as fully as it deserves and as would benefit your research. Briefly, it was myself and two friends. I connected the two of them_ they hadn't known each other until a few days before this event. We went camping in a national park. We spent about an hour trying to find the right place/right container. One of my friends led a ceremony with sage and invocation and asking each of us for commitment to openness before the journey. We had music, a psychedelic playlist. One of my major experiences throughout the entire 16 hours or so, was a deep appreciation of the individual plants and animals of the desert. I eventually turned this into a notion I called “desert style” as in the desert is incredible stylish, the same way one would call an Italian fashion model stylish. Not exactly like that but I am trying to convey that the beauty of the plants and animals wasn't just picture perfect but that there was a very vivid panache to these plants— they were ALIVE, sexy, they had a punchiness, and they had to protect themselves from the desert heat but they still SHOWED UP and DANCED when the time was right. In a non-literal sense I did experience some of the plants as becoming animistic representations of Native American people. I realize that the desert was absolutely full of life and this was in contrast to the way we humans think of deserts. This current ran throughout and was deeply positively felt, I realized how limited our normal perception is of what is alive, the value judgments we place on eg how the Amazon seemingly is filled with life, but the desert isn’t, but the reality is that life is everywhere and flourishes. Radiant.  At one point, I experienced the deepest terror I have ever felt. I was up on a rock, and it was windy, and even though I knew in my mind that each one of my friends was just around the corner, somehow when I looked back down and up on the rocks, it did not look familiar. I called out a few times and then started shouting, but because of the wind, nobody could hear me. Everything started looking more and more unfamiliar and I started thinking that instead of just walking 30 feet up the rock, perhaps I really had been wandering in the desert for hours on acid. I started thinking I was going to die, that I was hopelessly lost in the desert, that, even if I did the most rational thing which was to lie down and wait to stop tripping until the next morning, in all likelihood, I might’ve already wandered so far into the desert that I would never find the tiny isolated campsite (this was a huge desert, and we truly were in the middle of nowhere). It was a deep, existential terror that I have never felt before since like that. Then, suddenly a friend popped up and asked what I was doing and relief washed over me. At another point, I briefly had a paranoid thought, and then I realized that it was a paranoid thought, and when I looked at the desert, suddenly all the rocks lined up in a formation, making a wall around me, which symbolized what I at that time, thought paranoia meant, some kind of mental prison of the mind. I thought that was really cool to see the entire landscape transform congruently with my thoughts. I had some self doubt which generally comes up at some point, self punishing thoughts. Nothing too bad. Later in the trip. Early on, when I really was losing myself, I was lying down with eyes closed. I had a thought to just let go, and I experienced my entire body vaporize into billions of tiny dust particles, almost like soot. It was like there was a cloud of particles floating over a stream, and being dispersed by the wind. In that brief moment of having no body, at some point around then, I was imagining, if I truly was lost without a body, floating in some cosmic space, what would happen to me, and I could feel the love of my wife, and I knew that no matter what happened to my material self, she would always be able to find me. That was an incredible feeling.  We were still very much in the experience when the sun was close to going down, and we did not want to leave the beautiful spot, but we also knew we had departed, fairly far from the path to get where we were, and that we better start getting back to the campsite. By the time we finally tore ourselves away, it was dusk. We had a very hard time, finding any path, and eventually the path that we found was not the one we were looking for. It is important to mention that we were staying in a campsite that you had to drive , about two hours to get to through the desert, and there literally was absolutely nothing other than the campsite, and the road that went to it, other than desert for miles and all directions. So, going in the wrong direction on a path could be a disaster. we were all scared, but pretending we weren't. Eventually, one of my friends did find the way home, and we went through an oasis, which was just a depression that actually had some trees growing, no water visible. It was like a Hollywood set for a movie, like something they would’ve constructed to film king Kong in the 1930s. Just absolutely lush, lots of bug noises, much denser, plant material, the temperature was different, everything is different in this little oasis, and it was incredible to sense every single perceptual nuance. Purple everything.  We got back to the campsite and I made macaroni and cheese which my foreign friend had never had. I remember, as we walked through the campsite, even though it probably only accommodated 30 different spots, it seemed like we were at a concert, the noise of conversation, and the hubbub gave the impression that we were in the midst of thousands of people on the periphery of some giant concert. It was awesome. In my mind i had the impression i could go buy a sausage at a sausage stand. Of course, they were in reality probably only 40 or 50 people in the whole campsite, they were just having a conversation and eating dinner. But I'm pretty sure they were feeling the magic of this place, too. It is a pretty well known spot for this sort of thing! We put on some rock music and I danced around the fire with my friend. It was a song I hadn't heard in years but always loved, and it was a sexy, living, vibrant, raucous celebration of the undefeatable nature of life. My other friend went in his tent, and did some journaling. The stars and the sky were just absolutely stunning, and I could feel the energy of the place, the energy of the desert, radiating through everything. I was sharing a tent with my other friend, and he turned in to sleep, but I decided to go for a night walk around the campsite. All of the agave and other desert plants, vibrating with energy, dark purple in the starlight, alive, present, waiting to dance when the time was right…  I felt alive and awakened the next day. We flew back home that day after a drive to the city. Very awoken into the style of the desert, bartime bluesy rock n roll music, etc. I have had many psychedelic experiences before and since. I have to say I take issue with being asked to pick “the most important” or “the most significant” one: while there are many that aren't ultra profound, there are plenty that are, and it’s all part of a process, rather than one experience being the one that mattered most. This was one of the biggies, but it’s not outranked by several others. So for the record I am just picking one as such because I was asked to."
psychedelics,"I spent an unknown amount of time creating and destroying galaxies on my bedroom floor in total darkness. That was the night God died and I became the god of my own mind and, in turn, all of existence as the center of my perception. It occurred after about a dozen purposeful less intense experiences that led to the ritual of being clear of any other substances for a day, fasting for 12 hours prior, a self-guided come up and purposeful sensory deprivation during the peak. I believe the total time of the true experience to be only about 3-4 hours, but it lasted for an eternity. The come down was a particularly memorable calm with a diminishing psychedelic experience reactivated by cannabis for about a full day."
psychedelics,"It’s hard to put it into words, words feel very ‘flat’ or two dimensional and ill equipped to describe such a multi modal sensory experience… the ‘visuals’ were fairly strong as in geometric patterns and colours, plus the plants in the room were waving at me and beckoning me to keep going whenever I got close to a break through, but there were sort of secondary to everything else. I gained such unique and intense insight,,, I was sobbing really heavily from my whole body for what felt like hours, it was a really deep experience of emotions but it wasn't sad or distressing… it wasn't easy but it definitely wasn't bad. A song by the Beatles came on (here comes the sun) and the room went orange and i could see the warmth as a glow and I realised that it represented my psychologist who I was going through psychodynamic therapy with. I’d been in extreme pain for months and had been under home treatment as I was experiencing the psychological phenomenon of erotic transference and planned to end my life to stop the pain. I desperately needed his love and the agony of never being able to have it, despite having a loving and supportive husband who I love dearly, was unbearable and I was willing to do anything to make it stop. I somehow realised that my desperate yearning and love wasn't for him as a person but for him, the therapist as a concept. A concept of unconditional love, warmth, consistency, acceptance and reliability, and it was this concept that I desperately yearned. I suddenly became a baby and seemed to somehow recall screaming in agony for my mums attention for some need to be met, including screams of rage for her attention and comfort. I realised that it’s normal and natural to go through this as you grow as a baby and you naturally form other attachments and grow up away from mum so that you no longer scream and feel overwhelming emotions if she isn't responsive or gives other children attention, for example. I realised that the relationship with my therapist was so painful and intense because he was modelling a good, secure attachment that my mother should have provided, and that my ‘screams of rage’ that are perfectly normal as a baby, were happening live, as an adult. I realised that whilst i will never be able to have him, I will always carry with me his love as a therapist. I realised that what I actually desperately needed was my mothers love and that he had acted as a surrogate mother and filled in the gaps that she had been unable to whilst I was growing up as she herself was chaotic, impulsive and emotionally unstable. I saw in my head, but as though it was real, my mums arms wrap around me, except they were blue and icy, like steel. I realised that the basic foundations were there, as in she had provided me with the basics through her chaotic parenting so that I had some foundations about me. Then I felt/saw my psychologist arms wrap around me and they were orange, warm and soft and they softened the harshness of my mums love so that I was a more complete and rounded person with the basic ability to manage my emotions and care for myself. The music encouraged and assisted all of this, and the plants were waving me on to keep going, keep thinking, you're so close to figuring this out. It was the most incredible experience and it was so helpful. It didn't necessarily resolve my problems, but prior to this I couldn't understand how I could be experiencing the intensity of the transference. I'm still making slow and steady steps, but psychedelic experiences like this have changed the way I relate to my thoughts, I see them as a way of addressing things that just can’t be addressed by numbing them out with antidepressants. The issues aren't that I have a faulty brain and faulty neuro chemistry, it’s entirely reasonable that I would feel depressed given my difficult upbringing. So of course antidepressants won’t work. Psychedelics helped by somehow finding exactly what needed to be found and speaking with, understanding and reasoning with them,"
psychedelics,"My spouse and I set the intention of creating a safe space, no judgement, supporting each other through anything difficult. We took 50 mcg at a time x 4 over quite a few hours. We started by just talking in the hot tub then walking outside then sitting outside with your dogs. Then as the experience got more intense we went inside and lay on the floor and lay in each others arms and talked and talked. We looked right into each others eyes and told the truth to each other about our love and our relationship. What was beautiful and what was hard. We felt 100% trustful of each other. We both had a huge realization that we understood how much the other person really and truly loved them and that we had been missing that trust. It was incredible. It completely changed our relationship in the positive. We have so much more trust and comfort now with each other, and we have discussed it many times since then. We know that what we experienced was real and what was getting in our way prior to that was fear or feeling unlovable. I'm such a fan of this incredible experience. We had already done mushrooms together and I think this experience built on that."
psychedelics,"I suffer from various mental health disorders and I have been through therapy for them. I have been diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, which is crucial for the experience. I took LSD with my now ex-boyfriend. I have very traumatic childhood.  This Experience happened when I was 18-19. We were taking LSD and as usual I started crying. I cry very easily, so there's nothing exciting about that. I have experienced all my life very intense emotions. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode from them. On this trip, my intense emotions got a visual shape, more stronger than usual. I could describe it somewhat black mass, which is sharp, hard and electric - like the sun's surface. This shape/emotion usually takes over and due to my lack of emotional regulation I might engage in self-harming behaviours. On this trip however I closed my eyes and I saw infinite grey area with different sized black balls, which were same material as my ""emotion ball"". One of the balls came to me and covered me. I was inside the ball. I started crying more and I just sat there in the ball. The ball was one of my traumatic memory. I felt the feeling related to the trauma and I just let all of it in me. I don't remember how long I sat there but after awhile the started melting. My crying stopped and I felt sense of peace. I didn't open my eyes just yet and I still saw many other emotion balls floating around in the infinity. I realized that they were all some traumatic experiences. And I noticed that I could move towards them and they could move towards me. I opened my eyes, because I knew I couldn't handle another one just yet.  Many years later in University of applied science, I had a lecture where we learned about ""Structural dissociation theory"" if I remember it right. In the picture there was three types of dissociation disorders. In the theory there is AP which means Apparently normal personality. This is the personality part that goes through everyday life and is functional. There's also EP, emotional personality which holds the trauma. EP is also related to body and how body experiences trauma. They are separated and sometimes EP comes into the surface/to AP through dissociation symptoms. There were three degrees of severity. First one was PTSD, where there is one AP and one EP. Another degree is OSDD (other spesific dissociation disorder, which includes BPD) and there were one AP and several EPs. Last one was DID (dissociative identity disorder) and there were several APs and EPs. I almost spit the coffee out when I saw the picture because the dissociation structure for OSDD matched what I saw during my trip (I recommend to search the theory if it's not already familiar. Hope I remembered the name right): several different sized balls and they all were different parts of trauma. Later in the same class we discussed that trauma work is processing the trauma so that it becomes part of your narrative - it integrates into you. I did just that in the trip. After that I have taken this wisdom with me and I try to integrate my dissociated emotions and experiences in safe environment. There is still a lot of work to do with myself, but this is one life-changing experience that I carry with me the rest of my life."
psychedelics,"The one I'm thinking of was when my early childhood trauma was revealed to me. I was told that my dad anally raped me when I was about 10 months old which put me in the hospital and have cause life-long digestive issues, depression, OCD, and anxiety. It is also the reason I have struggled with Hemorrhoids off and on since I was young. My spirits told me that they had prepared me for this information and explained why it had to happen. I was immediately able to forgive me father, my mother, and everyone else involved - my grandparents had the money to cover it up so that their name wouldn't be ruined - they were prominent business owners in the community. Doctors, Preachers, and local Politicians were all involved in covering this up.  I grew up with my mom and dad both in the house and had a seemingly ""normal"" american childhood, never suspecting anything like this had ever happened to me. It was also explained to me that this was a common occurrence where I was raised (in the Southern US States) due to the sexual repression caused by the overly religious mindset of the south.  At first I had a difficult time believing it, but it made sense and explained how I was treated growing up, my mental illnesses, my physical issues (lifelong digestive problems and hemorrhoids), and I was even able to find some scars that I was previously unaware of.  They also explained that because of some of the backroom deals that were made by local politicians, it opened the door to a casino being built in the town some 43 years later - last July. The native americans that opened the casino have no legal right or claim to the land and another tribe fought them for years to keep it from happening since it is rightfully their land. Money is a powerful thing. My spirits had trained me for about a year to be able to handle this type of information and allow me to forgive. They said that I had suffered for it my entire life and it was time to let it go so that I would no longer have to suffer...but I had to know what happened in order to let it go. I was taking these journeys around twice a month leading up to this one to receive training on Trauma, conditioning/programming, mental illness, and other societal issues that plague america. They also trained me to be a healer and a psychedelic guide (my current profession) so that I may assist others with releasing their trauma."
psychedelics,I saw many nice patterns and colours. I felt relaxed and saw my life from a different point of view. Best of all- my headache wasn't as bad as it used to be
psychedelics,"I experienced an out of this world experience. I felt completely connected and one with the universe. As I came out i felt Love and understood. It was reported to me that while in the experience I screamed hysterically and my body was shaking, but I do not remember any of that. It was the most powerful experience of my life facilitated by 2 Shamans at a retreat in Mexico."
psychedelics,"I was in a remote cabin with three good male friends that I trust and with whom I have had many earlier psychedelic experiences. During the drug experience, we listened carefully selected music and used some light effects to have a relaxed and also stimulative atmosphere. During the peak of the drug effect, I went to lie down on the ground and let my body relax as much as I could. I started to feel growing amount of pleasure or bliss. I gradually lost the feeling of my body almost completely until I only felt the spine. Then I had an image or vision of my spine being a huge flamethrower. There was ""flames"" bursting out of every axis vertebra but the flames were not actual fire. The flames were pure pleasure that looked like golden light. I was pushing pleasure out of my body into the air. I thought that in this instant I felt more pleasure than I had ever felt before. Then I had an insight that this is the most important thing in human life, in human evolution. To experience as much of pleasure or bliss that is possible and to make this also available to all other beings. To become a flamethrower of pleasure for myself and others."
psychedelics,"A great meditation with a few strangers and a familiar guide in a beautiful meditation space, mindfulness focused on self-love and self-acceptance. First I met my body in its abstract form in the reflection of the candle in the glass of the fireplace stove, and then my soul. I was clearly aware that these were reflections of light, but I was also sure that these were parts of me made by those very reflections. They were wonderful and I chatted with them for several hours. There were several people around me, but no one disturbed me, I felt a connection, if I didn't want to be disturbed, the other person knew without using words.  I understood what was happening to my soul, I understood that it was frightened and that meeting my husband's soul saved me. I had the feeling that I was floating in a warm and soft liquid, I felt very comfortable in the physical sense of the word, everything was soft and pleasant, I danced and talked and examined my soul. The body then disappeared but I was overjoyed with my soul. I didn't feel like talking to anyone, I just hugged my guide and shared a moment of gratitude and love with him.  I literally swam in the beauty of my soul for a few dozen more minutes when I started to feel the weakening of those beautiful feelings. I was extremely thirsty and my jaws hurt. But the feeling of beauty and understanding did not leave me."
psychedelics,"Beautiful visual hallucinations intense catharses. cried and cried but don't know what about. feelings of paranoia arose, peace and insight along with gratitude."
psychedelics,"I had rented an AirBnb in a beautiful village hidden in the mountains surrounded by a vast pine forest. I went there with a woman who facilitates these experiences. We started with a 2 hour drive to the cabin where we got to talk a lot about anything and everything. Once at the cabin we prepared the space, with flowers, candles, fairy lights and pillows on the floor and blankets prepared. We had incents, essential oils and palo Santo in the room. We also made a play area with colouring books, musical instruments like drums and tuning forks in case we wanted to express ourselves with this.  We started with a silent meditation, then we had a cacao ceremony in which we mixed powdered McKennaii mushrooms to. I got 5 grams and she took a microdose to enter the space with me easier. Then we played music from a playlist that I choose together with her days before this day. I laid down for 45 minutes, didn't feel much. She offered me some tea and when I stood up I started feeling dizzy and got a slight headache. We sat down on the terrace drinking tea and watching the sun setting over the forrest as we continued talking. I was talking about many things, I couldn't control what popped up in my head. I just felt like telling her stories about things in my life etc. I often found myself forgetting what I was talking about and started laughing uncontrollably. I was surprised by how fun this was and kept laughing for a good hour or so. She was very understanding and listened to me as I was trying to speak, she acted like we were having a normal conversation even though it was far from normal. She just kept reminding me where I was in my story and encouraged me to finish them. After some time we went back inside to our prepared space, danced and sang a little. My dizziness was getting so severe I felt like I had to lay down for a bit, and then it hit me really hard. I was looking forward going through an ""ego death"" but what I felt was just an amazing experience. My whole body was feeling things as if it was the first time I felt them. As if I had just been born and was experiencing life and everything that goes with it for the very first time. She rubbed some essential oils on my wrists every now and then and encouraged me to smell it. And it was amazing.  I cried and laughed on and off. I didn't have any hallucinations, Maybe slightly blurred vision, like I needed glasses. I kept saying ""wow"" and ""how everyone need to try this, just once in their life"" how this could change the world if every human on earth did this. What an absolute wonderful experience it was. How can this be illegal? It should be criminal to keep this from people. I felt so much love! I realised that nothing is really important, nothing matters. We won't be here at some point in time and we won't matter then either. I have to point out that all of my ""realisations"" were thoughts and ideas I had already had, so it didn't come from nowhere, they were just intensified and solidified with the mushrooms. As I was coming down from the trip we did a Rapé ceremony to ground me and clear/sharpen my mind. Then she prepared a beautiful tray with grapes, nuts, dates and fruits that we ate together. I slept like a baby! The day after I felt an overwhelming feeling of joy and love. This experience will stay with me for a long time and I no longer feel the need to take anti depressants (I had weaned off the medicine 3 months prior to our ceremony) or feel anxiety as much as I did before."
psychedelics,"The most Intense Experience lastet ca 6 hrs. (250mg) It always starts with ""sonic boom"" like electric shock in the body accompanied with humm sound "" I call it sonic booms"" Its My favorite parts of experience. each sonic boom changes visualisation and set of experience. first - 2D monochrom or colorful visualisation then changes with another sonic boom to 3D visualisations green/yellow shapes (geometrical shapes - they felt like they were from Ivory) after another boom comes cosmic visualisation (objects in space ) like spheres and planetary rings. with this come communication either with y self or its EGO or GOD then another sonic boom comes and it Changes Visualizations to Large Alien-like Interiors of Structures it's absolutely beautiful regarding shapes and colors. Once I experienced my own deaths ( 7 at least ) each on different place and different type of deaths. like in Hospital, or shot down,, but the best was on Pirate ship - was so calming can't even describe it.  I had communication within myself - what is the purpose of Life. Answer was : TO BE then I had heate communication regarding : What is it you are trying to Achieve... Why do you want to get to Higher level??? And If I think it is so great to be a higher being that is capable of anything absolutely anything and in Order to feel something Anything you would need to create place where you connect with lesser being to experience yourself via their experiences..."
psychedelics,I was given a joint...did not know this was laced with a shroom. Myself and friend smoked but it certainly was longer that the normal joint high. I was wanting absolute silence but my friend continued to chat which annoyed me. I was flying like aladdin on a carpet and travelling around the moon. I was so close i could touch the craters on the moon. I loved the freedom of this journey. I have never forgotten this trip and often i want to feel the freedom of flying again.
psychedelics,"It was a relaxed and pleasant experience. I had anticipated and planned for more intense feelings and was slightly disappointed that this didn't happen. My thinking ""monkey"" brain continued firing the entire time which was also disappointing as i'd hoped to have ot quietened for a bit.  No visions or synesthesia. Felt some warmth and experienced white light briefly.  I had a short experience where i remembered an unpleasant situation from my young teens. I imagined adult me taking young me aside and comforting and loving young me. I was simultaneously both young me and adult me. Felt loving and care intensely.  No real after effects other than a floaty relaxation. Mild headache the next day."
psychedelics,"My mind setting: I want to know what is deep inside me, and perhaps beyond a somewhat ordinary state of consciousness. The body is so relaxed and so heavy... it's almost uncomfortable, like too heavy... You have to lie down and so heavy, so deeply relaxed and aware of it. Even the laundry is too heavy Inside my consciousness, I feel like I'm going to get lost... It's pretty scary... so I focus all my energy on being ""mindful"" (without thinking but just aware). .. Then I have stitches (old surgery), I feel them. Each of them hurts me... They concentrate a tension that prevents the body from relaxing in the depths of the subconscious. Sometimes I do acupressure exercises as if to focus and relax (to quiet my awareness). I see (I feel) that I am a deer that is caught in barbed wire and trying to escape. Focusing on stitches (surgery) I try to get into them and it works, I felt more relaxed. I felt like if I was entering into each stitch, then it becomes a luminous point and I disappear.  Afterwards, I rocked in my ""birth"". I'm in a fetal state, just before I was born... and I feel like I'm pushing to be born. I feel born.  --------------- A comment: All these experiences are extremely trying... but I believe they release something, unattainable without help. I wonder how far self-perception can go? I wonder if one only ever encounters oneself (one's expectations) or, when there is no expectation, what reveals itself to oneself. I also focused on friends that I like… as if to be more aware of them, of what they are going through. I love one of them, and I feel like it connected me to her... I wonder if that's why I relived my birth? There might be a link."
psychedelics,"I was really nervous going into ceremony. I was not looking forward to living through another night like the night before, which was my first ceremony. I had some rapé though and it had a very calming effect on me. I was really just concentrating on love and surrender, on how everything mother Aya is showing me, however terrifying, in the end is an expression of love and for my benefit. It helped.  This day the pinta (vision) was much clearer... no more sacred geometry. I arrived behind glass doors in some kind of transporting device. The doors opened and I stepped out into a city. I got into another ""train"" that took me to another station. I saw the year 2045 on the station where I got off. I stepped out into an unbelievable world full of sacred technology. The city was inhabited by all kinds of different alien species and humans. There were all kinds of transport devices, some moved on tracks within the city and others in the air between cities. I was either in the future on earth or on a planet that very much resembled earth. The cities here floated above ground in giant spheres. The ground underneath, the nature, was left untouched. You could go down there, but I got the feeling that you weren't allowed to live there. Perhaps there were plantations down there, but mostly it looked very pristine. I very much got the feeling this was earth and our future... this was how we had to survive by the help of other civilisations from other planets and allow Mother earth to heal from human impact.  The city was incredible. It was as if in this world, the different realms were mixed. Everyone on this planet was aware of the ""reality of truth"". There was sacred technology everywhere - amazing structures, works of art covered in symbols. Some of this technology served a purpose, some things were just stunning to watch... like this giant metallic thing that opened up spinning in levels (looking like a giant christmas tree) and it was covered in shining light blue symbols... just a work of art. There were open squares in the city where there was lots going on. There were markets, bars, restaurants, concerts, games and gambling going on. The aliens who were into gambling looked pretty rough. I was totally fascinated by what I saw. I just walked around looking at everything in aw. Shortly after arriving I found myself on an operating table and I had giant machines scanning my body. My teeth were already being operated on, I never saw who did it though, but I had serious dental work done. Perhaps they were extracting leaked mercury (from old tooth fillings) out of my body? After the scan I got back to wandering the city. I then met a weird spider-crab-like creature that was flying around in a little pod. It turned out he was a doctor. He had a bit of an attitude though (he sounded like a New Yorker) but he got up to my throat and as he crawled out of his pod I saw all his eight hairy legs had some kind of instruments on them. He started performing some kind of thyroid operation, sticking all his instruments into my thyroid really fast. It was really amazing. I felt so thankful for this odd encounter. This was one of the reasons I tried ayahuasca, to heal my thyroid. After I had my thyroid fixed, I continued wandering around the city and I came across my uncle (who had passed away a year before), who was just lounging on a couch enjoying his surroundings. We hugged and had a laugh, we even danced together for a while, it was really cool. My uncle was an old hippie who grew cannabis and did LSD in the 70ies, so he was really in his element in this world. He held his arm around my shoulder and said ""Now you get it"". I was very touched by this encounter. Looove was all I felt.  My journey in the city continued. I felt myself being pushed into a que behind a stage. In front of the stage I could see only humans partying. There was loud rave music playing. As I got up on the stage, I understood that this was some kind of welcoming party for people who had just passed over to this dimension. So I assume everyone on that stage were either doing Ayahuasca or some other plant medicine or LSD at the time and they were all showing up in this world and being cheered at by the crowd. It was pretty wild. I also ventured further down in the city and sadly I noticed that there was like a class-structure. I saw races of aliens that were poor, living in dark ""slums"", doing the hard work like cooking and cleaning, whereas the creatures further up (humans included) seemed to be better off. I felt disapointed by this. I kept coming across similar roller coasters in this city, as I saw in visions the night before. This time I saw the winged kundalini symbol above more clearly, so I figured perhaps this has more to do with rising my kundalini energy, than with purging. I tried to get on the roller coaster, but it wouldn't move. I still felt like I was meant to get on it... I felt very disappointed that it wouldn't move. This experience was so different to other experiences I have had on ayahuasca... it didn't dig into my psyche at all, but it was like a clear jump into another dimension. The clarity of it made it so memorable, no geometrical figures blurring the vision. The healing of my thyroid has lasted and I have been off my thyroid medication ever since and I'm doing good. I have also not been able to purge through vomiting ever (8 ceremonies)... I simply breath out the bad."
psychedelics,"Initially panic and feeling loss of control. Then timelessness - and many hours passed Then the strongest feeling of oneness, love and compassion that I have ever had for the other people the people in the room"
psychedelics,"We were 24 people in a large room with at least 7 helpers. It was organised by the British Psychedelics Society and took place in the Netherlands. There was preparation on the first day. On the second day we drank a tea made from the mushrooms. As I went into the experience I remember whispering voices nd psychedelic colours Then I seemed to rise up out of existence and saw my car very small and getting further away Time and space were dissolving I could hear other people in the room crying. At some point something dark green flew into me from the man next to me. From then on it went bad and I don't remember much more. Coming out of it I saw the clock and knew I was back in time. People were laughing so I laughed too. They were talking about oneness and the spiritual clarity they had experienced. But I not and knew I had picked up a disincarnate and could not contact the person who could clear me. That scared me because I was in Holland and had to fly home and drive from the airport. That night I had a terrible headache, shallow breathing and nausea, dry retching. Hardly slept. Felt dreadful. We were taken back to Amsterdam by coach and I could not speak to anyone. My phone battery was very low. I managed to email my entity clearing friend and she started to work. Somehow, step by step I managed the journey and get to the airport. For a few weeks after I felt depressed. Partly the disappointment because I had hoped for a spiritual experience, also the shock and being alone."
psychedelics,"We didn't have a scale and the mushrooms were so cheap that we had a bunch. Divided them all to 3 peoples(me included). We do not know the exact amount we ate so the amount i report is an estimate. The trip started with heavy nausea and loss of balance. The vision in my eyes seemed to overlap each other making it hard to see or evaluate forms, distances and eventually colors. Everything changed. At this point i somehow managed to get a comfortable spot from a mattress on the floor and notice my trip companions having the same idea. My spouse comes next to me while the friend is stationed close by at hands reach. Next i lose the concept of reality entirely and start to question everything. It's an endless effort as i try to make sense of things. Many things. The road starts to manifest as a street similar to the New york times square. There is lots of noise. Angry, confused, sad. People in the street start to huddle close to me and try to grab me or punch me. They stop almost at hands reach blocked by a steel fence and some of them are able to slightly touch me. I keep walking the narrow enclosed times square while vaguely recognizing some of the faces. They are people who have hurt me in different ways and they seem to be the most aggressive. The road never stops and finally i remember existence in the real world. I feel trapped in the trip and frustrated. The road continues. After a while (the concept of time doesn't apply here) i start to get frustrated in my own fear. I see a face from my past that used to scare me. Now i look at it(him) with a gringe and jump over the fence towards him in to the crowd. I am taken in with gentle arms. The times square vanishes and moulds in to bubbles. The angry faces that i saw earlier are in the bubbles and they all stare at me with a loving smile. I wake up from the trip and slowly start to recognize my surroundings. My spouse and friend come back at the same time(which is weird) and we talk about the experience. The afterglow of the trip is euphoric. Our friend starts to smoke some weed and gets ready to sleep. Me and my spouse go to our room and have sex. Good sex. I will remember it a long time. The end. Was fun going through the memories."
psychedelics,"I took a sugar cube that had drop of LSD infused. I was with my boyfriend in our home. First I was watching sitcom on tv, after a while, maybe an hour later I got a feeling of euphoria that I have never experienced before. Can't be compared to other types of euphoria, e.g. booze. At some point I moved to dark bedroom with a blindfolds. I can't remember much from that trip but the experience changed my life. Sometime during the trip I started listening ""This Naked Mid: Control Alcohol, Find Freedom, Discover Happiness & Change Your Life"" by Annie Grace. Alcohol usage has been a constant problem throughout my adult life and I had wanted to get rid of it for sometime. In that moment I just understood why I drank and something just clicked. After that experience I haven't drank alcohol in a destructive way like before and it hasn't been an issue anymore. Something fundamental changed, my brain got rewired."
psychedelics,I was trying to find the source of consciousness. I have found a place in my soul from which it is possible to drink from the infinite spring of life and vitality. Everything I thought of broke down before my eyes into its elemental parts and then reassembled. It amused me immensely. A very spiritual experience.
psychedelics,"I was with a friend hiking in the wilderness in North of Finland for several days. We didn't plane where and when we take the LSD but that we will. We found a beautiful spot next to lake. I had to take a shit, it's also relaxes the experience when u feel overall well, something like taking a shit might mark the whole experience so that's why I always want to do all that before. Also feel well eaten, not tired etc. The trees started to go really wild and psychedelic circle, and I new now we go. My friend got crazy I was thinking now if he kills me here when we are alone, I need to admit that I made a mistake. Don't remember what happened but the. He was really scared of the forest, our roles kinda switched BCS normally he knows the forest. I said it looks a savanna and he started to be scared of lions. But I was confident, I knew we were just tripping, I never forget that when I was ""travelling"" more frequently. Everything was super beautiful more than normally, the lake the forest, the trees. I enjoyed the vision rest of the trip and my friend calmed down also. I remember thinking these place could be done this and that it's so beautiful but also that o should be building my life, not there just dreaming of building something. Colours were so bright it was good feeling mostly. Then we slept on the tent, had sex next morning by the lake and started to walk back. Experience was really strong also for me, but now years later I think about it and what amazed me most was the change of my friend. He later became a psychiatrist, maybe that experience in a way was more to him than for me. What I got was the confidence of being me and the beauty of the experience in a visual way ."
psychedelics,"Experience nr. 1: Smoking hashish from a pipe. Went into a somewhat hallucinatory state, experienced waves of shifting mental states, like a rolling triangle where I always was on alternating edges of the triangle with a different feel to it - either a heavy feeling, or a energetic stressful feeling, or a nice balanced, harmonious feeling. Many years later I learned about the gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) and that they in some tantric theory are portrayed as a triangle that is balanced on its middle, but as it becomes unbalanced, the subject always experiences one of the sides as more dominant than the other. This is exactly what my experienced felt like. This took place in a storage room we rented to practice with our band in when I was about 18 years old. I was there with a couple of friends, and my experience was clearly stronger than the others had. It wasn't all pleasant, as it was stronger than I had expected and a bit confusing, and not a nice feeling while passing through the ""heavy"" part of the triangle. I had been smoking for approximately a year, perhaps once or twice a month, when this happened. Experience nr. 2: After smoking a mild joint (explicitly asked for a mild joint at a coffee shop in Amsterdam, because I was smoking with a friend - lover - who was not experienced). This took place an hour or so after smoking, but the experience was clearly affected by the cannabis. I had a feeling, while lying down in the bed at the b&b where we were staying, that I could see the edges of my concept world. Quite visually, that is, I could see my concept world (""my mind"" or what you want to call it) as something similar to a painting, and around the painting there were beautiful glowing edges, like a shining white light, that to me felt like my mind beyond the concept-world-painting. Just after smoking the joint I had not felt much, just perhaps a bit relaxed, so this feeling came on only when we had stopped socializing, and I was on my own - mentally - waiting to fall asleep. But please note: I was not falling asleep, I was quite awake and I marvelled at what a strange and quite pleasant experience this was. I hadn't smoked cannabis for over 13 years when this happened."
psychedelics,
psychedelics,"I go into the bathroom - absolute darkness, viscous and tangibly soft, a visible veil, woven from all colors into a single blackness. I don't remember how I ended up in the tub. I don't see my hands, I don't see the edges, dense jungle thickets begin to flicker there and hungry tiger pupils follow through the vines. The rite of initiation of the ancient tribes, you will never return to yourself, even if you do not die. Further inland, falling through the animal paths, faster and faster through the night, the whistle of the bowstring cuts the rustles, the body, collected in a spring, before the jump. It is difficult to come up with a new plot, and vague images fit best into the old rut. Cold ceramics under the back - the stones of the altar, a ray of light through the dusk on a raised blade. What for? Pain in the opened chest, like a step. A step into a stone well and booming chants melting above. The despair of the sacrificed, dazzling white as an icy desert, so strong that it is taken out to where it is impossible to categorize sensations. Spears passing through, but hands reaching out from all sides to plunge into the hot blood destined for the gods. The blood and throbbing hearts of the gods are in my hands. The subject and object of this sacrifice. To move the sun from the sky! I scatter into fragments, unwind into threads, tree roots in countless fractals into the bowels of the earth. Nails in the palms and hellish heat - to die for each of them, to breathe in each.. Just to become them, just to stay in them. An endless wasteland and an army that follows me into battle. Oh, if only they, following me, knew what it was like to go ahead! What an eerie dizzying feeling of an empty dusty infinity ahead and a legion behind. And I walk in each of them, look at the back of my head, and feel the sight of my own gaze. Gods, how many there are! Countless legion of black shadows marching behind me, so that the world shakes from their steps. Someone's gaze is an angstrom behind my retina, someone through a thousand light-years distinguishes the inside of my eyes. Why so many of them? They have always been here! How did I not notice this before? And they all go, go, go after me, turn their heads in phase, are not reflected in the mirrors. Filmstrip fragments of someone's life that has come true and seen for the first time. How could you ever feel alone for a moment when they were always here? Who is there? There is no one here but you! How did I not notice? It would be funny to me from the feeling of absolute non-loneliness, if there was someone to laugh. They fill everything, the world rushes down, losing its forms and connections, into the beyond from under their feet, breaks, unwinds, falls apart, scatters, down and in breadth, the fabric of a single canvas into everything and nothing. And then it rolls up, rolls up, rolls up from the unattainable periphery, spinning and twisting dizzily, flies to the center at a superluminal speed, falls into the singularity of one dazzlingly bright point, black hands reach out to it from the void. Flash somewhere in the solar plexus. I open my eyes. Before them again colored darkness. I lie curled up on the floor, unable to believe that I can look, that I can move my arms, that I can feel the cold. I hear the laughter that fills the room, it takes me a while to identify it as my own. How did you not notice them before? It's cold - one of them, hugging me, puts a sweater on me. Where is sweater from? Damn it, what a simple but extraordinarily clear hallucination. Somewhere in the other room, music is playing. I can't believe that I can get up, that I'm walking through the visible darkness in my own, pieced together body. And my legion strikes a step behind me. How do I remember the faces and names of two people in this apartment? I remember the name and the past, the one about whom I can still say ""I"" with confidence. It brings out bursts of hilarious surprise. I am very well and illegally calm. I want to tell them everything so as not to lose it, but now I don't have enough words for this, no eloquence will be enough even later, when in six months I try to clothe it in tight words. I don't know how long it went on, probably more than a couple of hours. The rest of the trip until the morning, I danced, looked, spoke, but already somehow lazily, still not moving away from the minutes on the bathroom floor. As if the brain, realizing that it was too early, tried to step back and analyze what had happened and not finding answers, lazily scratching in the skull. Did I really want salvation at that moment?"
psychedelics,"I did half of an MDMA tablet and 3/4 of an LSD paperboard. I first felt the MDMA effects feeling light and happy, then I felt the LSD feeling a little bit anxious.It was a party my friends and I were throwing at my buddy's house and I was in charge of music, I did a mix for it and hype was created in general around that party we organized each year and for the music mix, I did. However, the music couldn't hear loud and clear and in the end, the mixtape didn't work, when that happened I was high enough that I couldn't solve it, so I got anxious because of that.  After that the party went well, I danced and enjoyed it but at the end when there were like 10 people left I started to tripping out very hard. I felt as if I was in loops, as if nobody could leave the party because everyone had to find some belonging first. After that, a friend of mine was complaining very often about a friend that got very alcoholized. At some point everything was about this friend complaining about the alcoholized friend and I didn't feel comfortable with that, so I had a psychotic break feeling in a constant loop where everyone was talking about this guy.  Somehow I started to think that everyone hated me and that I discovered that my whole life was a product of my mind, that the goal of life is to realize that you are a bad person and the only path is to end with your life, that scared me so much.  After 45 mins like that, I got back to reality and went to bed until I fall asleep."
psychedelics,I had surrendered to my shadow and experienced my longing and my deep sorrow for being separate from Oneness. The experience was hard to take but was the beginning of a healing journey.
psychedelics,I had an experience at a public beach when I took magic mushrooms. People were talking to me but I couldn't really hear what they were saying and I saw all kinds of colors. Once I went swimming it stopped.
psychedelics,"(the report is based on notes made at the time) I was alone for the entire experience. The experience begun very quickly and after about 1 hour was very strong. Everything was intertwined: thoughts, concepts, bodily feelings, emotions, social anxieties etc. The experience was challenging and included strong resistance to ego death, but also a realization that it's all as simple as letting go. I reflected on my propensity for instant resistance to everything unknown and whether this had changed to some degree. I had previous experience with psychedelics but felt that this experience was more like a psychedelic experience ""should be"" and that some sort of a block had been broken. Continuous observations about myself and my life were made, and I noted the importance of implementing some of them in my daily life. (practically none of these observations were remembered afterwards and certainly not implemented.) I also noted an experience of ""perfect living with self/light"". After about 2,5 hours, I had a period of strong crisis. At this time, the ability for conceptualization and making sense of reality had already returned close to normal. The crisis involved a bodily and mental struggle for life and death with a visualization of trying to climb out of a deep well. Just as my strength ran out and I was about to give up, I was helped by what felt like an outside force. Innumerable hands reached out from a source of light to help me. This light then transformed into an incredibly immersive vision of a source, existing at the boundary of death and life, that simultaneously absorbs and emits life/souls/consciousness. Immediately afterwards I noted that being able to trust opened up immense stored-up emotions. I felt that I had made a connection with a deeper self beyond any reasonable doubt - despite that every doubt indeed had been reasoned. I also noted that surrender to the experience rewarded beyond any description. After the episode describe above, I felt for a short time great peace with myself and euphoric mood. I felt for example that my myriad personal problems were in the end completely insignificant. I described this in my notes and in remarks made to others at the time as a ""level up in life"" and a true ""religious experience"". I felt that this must be the way one should live and feel - that perhaps it was something like enlightenment. I doubt that it is possible to describe this ""perfect"" mode of consciousness and way of existing in words that would do it justice. However, I was also aware that this would likely not last for long. After about 4 hours I again started being skeptical towards such things as spirituality, and noted that the more one is skeptical, the more ""dualistic"" everything becomes. After 6 hours I felt tiredness, anxiety and immense yearning. I wondered where the confidence and perfect feeling of just a few hours ago had vanished. At the end of the day I reflected on the issue of trust and the lack of it. I noted how obvious it was that I was not spiritually and physically - which felt like the same thing - able to receive the immense energy and light inside, and that it was of the uttermost importance to make lifestyle changes such as starting meditation and regular exercise, adjusting my diet and generally changing my way of life for the better. I noted that any deeper work with psychedelics would require this and that this experience should be motivation enough. I noted that a shortcut made with psychedelics will not help without much work and integration. Finally, I noted that I had searched for something without knowing what it is_ I had searched it for the ego with the ego, despite it being achievable only by trusting oneself and letting go of the ego. (This experience happened a very long time ago. I did not implement any of the lifestyle changes mentioned above, have no great interest in spirituality, and have not used classical psychedelics since.)"
psychedelics,"I was near prague in a forest at a hippie festival with less than 100 people. We were with my friends from america and a couple of friends who we knew through my mutual friend, and they provided mdma. I had taken it before, but never had this intense of an experience.  We eyeballed the amount, cause we did not have a scale. But these people had experience so i trusted them.  I was coming up on mdma while lying on the grass next to a ”holy fire”. This festival was like 40-50 + year olds mostly and had been coming here for 70 years. There was a live band playing with random cool instruments. The place felt very safe.  I was laying in the dark on the cold wet grass and could feel the heat from the fire. It was amazing, i could not stop saying how amazing everything was and how connected i felt to everyone. Later we went to our friends cottage next to the festival, he played violin and sang songs. I walked from person to person giving them rubs and hugs and loving everything. It was magical.  The sensation felt like love. Just pure love and happiness towards everyone and everything. Mdma is a wonderful drug when used correctly."
psychedelics,"A total reboot of the brain and self_ re-constructing my whole existence from a scratch. The so-called ""ego death"". The experience itself was terrifying, but it helped me a lot."
psychedelics,Vaping a dose of 5-MeO-DMT I felt like dissolving into a unified consciousness field beyond space-time. A mixed feeling of bliss and terror to be confronted with some sort of ultimate ontological reality that meanwhile was so distante of the ordinary sense of reality and of my limited self image. At the end of the experience a sense of frustration rouse when thinking on how much could be learned about the nature of reality and consciousness if scientists and philosophers would actually have the courage to explore this substance instead of playing conceptual speculative games.
psychedelics,"This is my account of the experience that I wrote a few days after it happened, approximately 2.5 years ago. Then I have some notes from a therapy session after that. The experience happened at a beautiful house in the countryside, with 3 friends. A perfect set and setting. I was in a reasonably good head space at the time, not depressed. Two of the friends and myself have PhDs in psychology/ neuroscience, and two of them are medical doctors. One is a psychiatrist. All had experience with psychedelics, including LSD. I had extensive use of a range of psychedelics (several times per year since I was 18, at the time of the trip I was 33). I have the most experience with LSD, and have taken significantly bigger doses than this. I took one tab which I believe was about 150 micrograms, but couldn't be 100% sure. It was definitely acid.  I had been raped 2 years earlier and now have a PTSD diagnosis from that experience. I was not officially diagnosed at the time of the trip, but had previously had therapy for one year afterwards, and am getting help again now for the PTSD and depression.  The experience was extremely intense, draining, and unpleasant at the time. But it was also cathartic and fascinating, and lead to me telling my parents about the rape, which I doubted I would ever do and am very glad I did. The experience (written a few days after the event): The bird was the first thing we saw when we got back from exploring the forest. It was round, white and brown, lying still on its back on the table outside, with its fat belly faced the sky. M was quick to grab it by its feet and throw it over the balcony. Later, L said she wished she'd looked at it more. M wondered why his instinct was to throw it away. To take control. We were all scared of it, because it was dead. Well, we had to get rid of it. But that's not true. We wanted to get rid of the reminder of death. M brought it up intermittently during the next few days, wondering why the bird flew into the window. As if it had conscious agency.  We dropped acid at half 11 in the evening. The come up was visceral and quick. M and I were watching the orange supermoon rise, and looking back to the sunlight that never went fully down, giggling and amazed. A net was suspended over everything, with it's strings running through the clouds, the trees, and the grass. But if I tried to focus on the net, it would morph and disappear, then reform. Over and over, M and I would realise we wanted to go to the lake, run inside to convince L and J, fail to convince them, and then repeat the cycle. Sitting inside, the colours in the music made me cry. I noticed I was trying to fight it and instead consciously relaxed into it and felt relief. Maybe that was the floodgates opening. We started walking to the lake about 3-4 hours into the trip. Felt good, excited. There was a neon glow shifting through the grass, and the sky was smudgy pink. We were walking down the stairs and I said ""Hannah would hate this, I've gone to the countryside and taken acid, like in midsommar"".  I suddenly felt this intense weight and confusion. Everything slowed down. I wasn't sure what was real. I had this awful feeling that something terrible had happened. But I wasn't sure if the memory was real or not. I wasn't even sure if the concept of rape was real. I couldn't understand how or why someone would do that, surely people don't hurt each other like that on purpose. I'm not sure what words I said aloud and what was in my head. L said it was all fragments, but that each loop started with ""violently though?"". And ended with ""right, ok"". She could convince me I was safe for a second then I'd snap back into the loop. She said each time the loop restarted I'd look at her like I looked in the photo. I didn't know if she was real. ""Why is this happening?"" ""We took lsd"" ""right, ok"", back to the loop. It started with me being upset about not having told my parents about the rape. I feel disconnected from them because they don't know, but I'm too scared to burden them. But then I wasn't sure if the rape had actually happened, or if the person X who raped me was real, so I'd ask L again, ""violently tho?"" ""X tho?"". The words came out in slow motion because I wasn't sure if they were words or not, and whether they meant what I thought they did. Then I felt trapped in sheer terror, like the rape was happening again. M said ""it's not happening now, you're safe"" and I trusted him but also couldn't snap out of it. He asked me to name the emotion. I said scared. They told me over and over that I was safe and I'd start repeating ""safe"" but it wouldn't last. I said that I blame myself. That I should have known and seen it coming. And that the world tells me it is my fault. I felt angry and frustrated. M asked what I was feeling and I said shame. All I have are vivid sensory snapshots, but there's no continuity to them. Reaching out to touch the purple flowers. The cat slinking along the fence. Eating a peach and not being sure if it was delicious or disgusting. The shimmering pastels of the lake. I wanted to jump in. I remember coming out of the loop: I saw the moon. It was filled with warmth and light and colour and I couldn't believe something could be that beautiful. Maybe not everything was bleak and awful. I giggled. L skipped down the path saying ""A's back, A's back"". I remember M saying it too and I didn't understand what they meant. Walking back to the cabin felt like waking from a dream. Back at the house J asked if I remembered, and I wasn't really sure. They said they hoped I had got something out of what happened. Later, when the acid was soft background noise and we were looking out at the trees from the balcony, I said to M ""I don't understand what happened to my mind earlier"". He said he thought it was a PTSD response and that my mind had been stuck back in the rape. I realised that it was what it had felt like, and cried a little. He said, ""I might be reading too much into it, but I think your anxiety doesn't just belong to you, but is also your mother's and your grandmother's."" That struck a nerve as well, how did he know that? I hadn't even mentioned my grandmother as far as I knew. But she was extremely anxious.  I lay on the grass all day, listening to music and soaking up the warmth of the sun, enjoying what was left of the trip. Speaking to L the next day was a useful debrief. She filled in a lot of blanks and a lot of what she said sparked more snapshots. I was shocked when she said it lasted 2 hours or so. She said she could feel the trauma rippling through me, and through the landscape. That she felt helpless and moved. I told her that she did help. I'm so glad I was with the people I was with when it happened. I can't help but feel some guilt for them having to experience that with me but they seem to have got some insight out of the experience too, and I know they wouldn't blame me for it. We discussed whether I should tell my parents, and she suggested my brother could do it. I am thinking about it. I wonder if this is how psychedelic therapy works. I'm sure it's not supposed to happen quite like that, but maybe it opened a door to something that I wasn't able to access in a normal state. It's scary that those feelings are still inside me, but I guess it makes sense. Maybe they will always be there. M said he thought it meant there was something still unresolved in my feelings about the rape, that there's more to process. I hope that the experience helped me process further. It did feel cathartic. It was 3 days ago and I'm still completely physically and emotionally drained.  The following week I felt exhausted, like I used to feel after therapy. Waking up was too hard so I just stayed dozing until noon or later. I needed coffee but it made my heart race. I made myself eat but mostly didn't feel hungry. I managed one Pilates class, which felt weird but good, after 3 months of not stepping foot in a gym. It was hard to focus on watching tv or listening to podcasts. Working was even harder so I did the bare minimum. I had the familiar feeling that I was thinking and moving in slow motion. It reminds me of when I was depressed, and was first processing the rape. I tried to practice self compassion, and remember that these feelings don't last forever. That my productivity always comes back.  Afterwards I spoke with my therapist, these are my notes: Trauma lives in the body. Part of treatment is to viscerally release while you feel safe. Scary that it's still inside me but maybe less of it is in there now. It did feel cathartic. With psychedelic therapy I would have known it was coming, planned, felt more in control, mentally prepped, had a guide, taken time off work, etc. So understandable to find it traumatic. But they were good guides. Maybe going into it was more conscious than it seemed? Did I allow myself to go there because I felt safe? So meaningful to share that experience with other people and give them a deeper understanding of this kind of trauma. Gives insight as a doctor, psychiatrist, friend. It's the same big feelings and difficult stuff that we dealt with in therapy coming out, without the intellectual understanding. Self blame. Not being able to believe that it happened. Wanting to understand why but there being no good answers. Similarities between the trip and the rape: Fragmentation and lack of continuity Confusion and fear - not knowing what was happening Lack of control My therapist said ""Your face looks good"" She thinks it will be a positive experience. Says she can see it in my face. She's always been good at reading my face. Never know how my parents knowing might be helpful in the future. Would I want my daughter to tell me, regardless of how much anxiety it would cause me? Yes of course. Allow myself to stop protecting them and let them do that for me. Next steps Be kind to myself, take it easy Look at my relapse prevention plan Go back over my timeline of the rape, and to my timeline of the trip. Solidify the continuity, help make sense of it. Move it from my amygdala to frontal cortex."
psychedelics,"I have written everything down one day after the experience so that is why I remember all quite well. It lasted 12 hours as a whole, from 2pm to 2am. First, after about half an hour ago I started to laugh hilariously. I was with my boyfriend, we were playing one card game and after it first hit I noticed I didn't know anymore how to play the card game we were playing. My whole body felt lazy and my movements were slow. We went laying on the bed and then some visual hallucinations started to occur. I have many house plants so those started to shimmer and move vividly, like the colors were flowing through the plants. Colors were more intense everywhere in my home and the walls seemed to breath, moving closer and further away from me. Then I looked at the white ceiling above me and started to saw colorful and moving illusions, it was like a mandala and there were many eyes in there. It was dark colored, mostly blue and purple. What was interesting, I saw the mandala only on the ceiling, not on the walls that was also white colored. However, every other surfaces seemed liquid and the shapes of my carpet and sheets were moving smoothly around. That was the most beautiful moment of the experience. I can't tell how long that phase lasted as I lost the sense of time. After x time period, maybe one or two hours after, all the colors disappeared and everything went black and white. Also the outer world I saw from the window went dark even though it wasn't yet dark according to the phase of the day. Then I felt little bit anxious and scared because it was so sudden change. Then I remembered what I'd read that everything just need to be welcomed and accept as it is. We were still laying on the bed. Then something started to drag me to one corner of the apartment, like some gravity. We went there together and we just sat there for some time and nothing new happened. It was absurd and we felt little bit stupid.  Then after some time colors came back to normal. And all the brightness and colorfulness before the darkness was gone and everything in my home looked quite normal. Although, proportions of the apartment, me and my boyfriend were unrealistic, betweentimes for example legs looked longer or bed looked smaller. Most of the time of the whole experience we were laying on the bed or sitting on the sofa doing nothing. I didn't feel my body and it felt like ""I"" was just my consciousness. I looked myself from the mirror and I saw myself older and uglier. I drew and I felt like the hand that was drawing wasn't mine. I didn't have appetite. We listened to some music and I saw the whole room changing colors according to the music. It was so beautiful. We had difficulties in communicating each other and we tried read some book but we didn't understand the context and we came up with some new meanings of some words. Couple of times I cried but however I didn't feel sad. There were moments when we felt like the trip was already over and we felt sober, but then all the time there were still those mandalas and other hallucinations on the walls and ceiling for long time.  Overall the main feeling of the experience was little bit anxious and very bizarre, like we were some strange creatures. There was a little feeling of mysticism but however, we didn't feel spiritual as how many people usually describe. Silence sounded very intensely silent and time had stopped. It felt like we were a part of a whole different reality."
psychedelics,Connected with generations of ancestors - specifically women - grandmothers  I helped to purge trauma in toilet and they guided me to lay outside under the moon and stars - I heard them supporting me as I felt my body ascend up to a vessel-like structure that had petal-like wings on it. I felt their presence and my whole being felt a great sense of peace and oneness. I felt connected to everything. Eventually I started to sink into the ground.
psychedelics,"I was at my friends place and we had prepared ourselves with sauna and a meal. We made a tea and drank heroic dose of mushrooms which i had grown. Roughly 5g of psilocybe cubensis. This was maybe the 20th time of us eating mushrooms. After the tea, we closed the curtains and every light in the room, it was pitch black. The trip started as normal trip, but as it usually would’ve eased a bit after 1h or so, this time it kept getting more intense. At first i got scared and thought what have i done to myself as everything started to melt into as constant stream of energy. Everything seems really beautiful, colorful, bright fractals everywhere and of course a hefty euphoria after the initial nausea. Pretty soon it made no difference if i had my eyes open or closed. As i started to lose words and ability to conceptualise anything, i was sure that i had died, moving on to the next phase of life journey or just vanishing to nothing. At first it felt awful and i regretted that i took the mushrooms, but after some time when i was able to formulate thoughts again, i felt it was meant to be. At first i cried, then thought that what are people going to think about that i had killed myself with drugs. Then i started to think about all the good things i have had in life and i laughed. I remembered the things that i regretted in life and felt sad. Sort of made a list in my head what i would do other way if i had a new chance. I thought about all the people in my life, my dog, everything. Remorsed the mistakes i made. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. After an hour or so i started to come down from the trip and the connection to reality gave a glimpse of itself. I realised that maybe i did not die and that i might have survived. It took maybe 2-3h to come fully down back to reality, a time which i spent processing everything that i had gone through just now. While processing one question kept coming to my mind_ what do i want people to remember me after i have really died. What are people going to say at my epitaph. To answer to what i would like them to say in it, i set the question as an intention to my next trips."
psychedelics,"I have experienced numerous different type of psychedelic experiences, with mushrooms, LSD, Ketamine, DMT, Changa, 5meoDMT, mdma, ayahuasca. I have talven them separately and ny combining them in various combinations.  LSD trips was the start and it made me heal my mind by going through various events happened in my life and making peace with wrongs i experienced and wrongs i caused. It helped me finding out who i truly am. Mushrooms took me into a way much more spiritual level. First big trip i did by myself consuming 6g. Experience lasted several hours taking me through seven different levels consisting of various nature like elements as webs, snakes, lizards and evolving into more and more abstract while it continued. Eventually I made contact with some sort of superintelligence and stayed at its presence for some time. We communicated in curious way without words.  Next big experience I had with DMT by smoking it. I had so called breakthrough experience where I got completely out of my body and entered into this psychedelic multidimensional space, which seemed to be at the same time me and this other entity who was the entire existence in there. One might say it was so called god I was meeting there and practically was part of that myself. I recall being scared and having a deja vu kind of feeling that I shouldn't be here yet, as if I knew the place somehow already, which I surely didn't. But afterwards I have thought of that place is where we enter when dying. Maybe my spirit or soul has travelled through it before I was born and therefore it felt somehow familiar.  Then I have experienced various out of this world experiences with various substances and combining them. With Ketamine I managed to treat many psychic and physical things. Physical ones were quite interesting. I had a wrong position on my leg for at least twenty years. Under influence of ketamine my original nervous system activated and fixed the wrong position my leg had been. It didn't fix it permanently but made me aware or the problem. Then I started using ketamine to train the nervous system and fixing the position of the leg so that it is now correct all the time.  Would have endless amounts of experiences to write about, but here is a glimpse into them."
psychedelics,"My friend called me accidentally one afternoon to fix a thing I got for him from Tori. He told me he’s going to Nuuksio for an Ayahuasca ceremony and the curanderos are indigenous reliable ones he has met in Amazonas. I had attended several ceremonies before that, but then the curandero has always been finnish. We went to a nearby place, relaxed a bit, had sauna and I got the permission to inhale some cannabis.  Towards the night we, about 10-15 ppl wandered all together to the ceremony place, which was a small plaza-like square in the forest. The place felt like an ancient ceremony place. The curanderos were already there, having a fire, music, chanting.  We settled down. I had 2 yoga mats with me and some extra clothing if the night’s gonna be chilly. On the contrary. It was the most pleasant warm summer night.  I was also offered some mescaline before the act, but refused as I was nervous of what’s going to happen this time. I was offered one bony cup of ayahuasca as my turn approached. It tasted horrible as usual, I thanked and got back to my mat. I just listened to the most beautiful indigenous music in the most beautiful night. I laid myself down. First came an extreme thankfulness that flooded me all over. I watched the three branches over me, they were so extremely beautiful and visually so speaking that tears just started running from my eyes. I don't know how long I stayed in this stage, maybe some 15 mins as the experience became more intense.  The tree branches no longer felt safe and beautiful, they started haunting me. A was in a very intense anxiety for a long period, I even asked some help from the curanderos. Someone came, there was a ritual over me, and the finnish organizer came to conform me for awhile. Before the trip I had been working in a company, in a wrong position, in an entrepreneur setting w huge responsibility. I had had an inner yearning for spiritual practises and started meditating regularly some time before my trip. During the trip in Nuuksio all my inner controversies and even my relation to materialism popped to the surface. I remember arranging my few belongings besides the yoga mat like if someone would come&steal my fortune. I just didn't know what’s going to happen. The stage I stayed in, the more unsafe&intense, lasted about 2 hrs, I later asked the arranger. Then I started vomiting (or was it before this, I don't know). After the intensive phase the tears and thankfulness came back. I was in heaven, peaceful, the surroundings and the music's just flooded over me or even felt like the sounds would come inside of myself. I had a loving feeling for everyone and everything. After the night we wandered back to the house and relaxed."
psychedelics,"Dmt is such a powerful drug, so breakthrough is almost impossible to describe strictly. The whole environment transformed into hyperspace-like another dimension. I saw colours that don't exist, some insect-like entities that were kind and talked to me telepathically. The world was like I was in four-dimension universe. I kinda understood all objects and entities, but after the trip it was impossible to describe the experience. Like you can't explain a four dimension cube. After the trip I was in euphoric state for few hours and felt very relaxed Many weeks without insomnia and anxiety. The experience was so powerful that I want everyone to experience DMT. The world would be a better place."
psychedelics,"I've been using Ayahuasca 2-3 times a year since 2016. According to cooking process you need 5-10 grams of material. I cooked 7.5 grams, so this was ""medium"", though at the time the cooking process was very unreliable and had given me varying results.  At this point I've had Ayahuasca experiences a few times, so I knew what to expect. Therefore I made some preparations to relax and de-stress myself. Such as leave early from work, go to gym and of course not to drink coffee that day. There is whole diet you need to follow about 24 hours before and after due to MAOI-component. This might seems irrelevant but Ayahuasca experience is the whole process instead of just ""take this and your mind goes boom"" After taking the drug I watched Rick and Morty, the television screen had slight bluish tint and I did not feel like following the program anymore. I take it as sign to move to bed and turn on my special music playlist for the experience. At this stage I have no idea how strong the potion is. So I worried about is all this effort going to waste? What if it is magically stronger than anticipated, what then? The society certainly does not approve. You are on your own on this one. I had darkened the bedroom, headphones ready, all you need to do press play and get comfortable on the bed. I thanked the past me. The patterns started appearing. It was very similar as if you are falling to sleep, except these patterns don't vanish if you start thinking something else. At first is was simple colors, then more colorful, repeating patterns appeared. Colors so pure you can only imagine. Music became the patterns. Every breath felt fresh on my gums, I felt joy. The patterns became more aggressive and changed too quickly for me to follow. I started rolling on the bed from some kind of mental exertion, breathing became heavy, and I felt the need to touch my temples. Thought my closed eyes I could see my hands on the patterns. They kind of turned yellow where my hand and fingers should have been. I reached for sparkling water bottle under the bed. I didn't need to see it. I just knew it would be there. The bubbles tickled my mouth. I gave a laugh. It was pure joy. After what felt like long time I remember being less and less aware of my body and concentrating more of what was within. Like in your dreams you are not aware of your actual body. I had no body but I was floating in the middle of this ""stuff"". I started seeing people as in memories from the past. It was strange, like ""oh, this is the interaction you had, this is the effect this particular encounter had on your current self"". It was bleeding obvious to connect the dots. The memory of a girl with whom I had used psychedelics (magic truffles) with for the first time came to me. The memory was bright yellow and it kind of made all the other visions bland. She in a way had enabled these experiences, without her I would not have this experience.  The visions started slowly to fade and I became more aware of the music again. I realized the visions had been kind of landscapes created by each song. In the end checed time. I had been only 1.5 hour but felt like a way longer time. I didn't feel tired, so I turned on my computer. The ""gods"" behind the Youtube algorithm had given me a recommendation. It was a documentary about... Furries. I pondered for a long time if my mind could take that kind of information right at this moment. Yes it did. For a couple of days afterwards I felt energized. It was clear that choices I had made couple of year ago were correct and it was now very obvious what steps I should take next. It was like ""oh yeah, why it wasn't like that before?""."
psychedelics,"my first Ayahuasca trip ever... First we took the first shot Ayahuasca and laid down, during the first hour to one and a half id say the experience was like a strong LSD trip visuals mostly. it was after the 2nd shot it started. I had almost fallen asleep when when I felt a strong urge to purge, when I did throw up it wasn't like the normal puke.. It felt like someone ripping out a bowling ball from my stomach, it kind of felt like a relief. At this stage the visuals was really strong, what I puked out of me looked like the pattern Alex Grey has in all his paintings, was kind of the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, and that pattern continued to grow from the puke bucket and got connected to the whole room around me. Then the trip really started, this will be hard to really explain all of it, but I totally lost time of space and time, I was drifting in and out of it, I actually thought that I had been on that mattress for days instead of hours. I did see my life in review, from beginning to end, i drowned I screamed for help etc. it started over and continued.. Also during this review I saw myself in a lot of different situations but it felt like I was seeing everything from behind a shower curtain. I was there but I was not ""fully there"" not present (I had been using a lot of cocaine and alcohol the last 20 years, self medication I can see in hindsight). It felt like I was looping in this stage for an eternity, the loops went on and on, some different life situation where shown to me. It finally stopped when I sat up and I slammed the wall behind me and screamed ""THIS IS ENOUGH"" , finally it stopped, and then I understood that I wasn't living the life I wanted. (I have been sober since, and myself healing work started)"
psychedelics,"After years of struggle, it showed that it is possible to experience and see the world in a completely different way that no amount of therapy or talking or reading or any other thing would have ever convinced me that is possible."
psychedelics,"I took the mushrooms alone in my home on a Saturday. The weather was beautiful and I had time for myself for the day and the next. I had taken psilocybin mushrooms about 15 or 20 times before but never quite as large amount. However, I had a decent idea of what was coming. I drank the mushroom tea and put on some nice psybient music and waited. After maybe half an hour I started to feel the first effects and the onset was pretty smooth. I started to yawn and headed to my bed to wait for the peak. I think I actually fell asleep. No idea for how long. Then I woke up. At first I was, not standing, but existing in a space made of light. There were others with me and the spoke calming words. I was not afraid in the least, but curious as I was just woken in this place. After some time I was guided through a hatch of sorts and the entities told me that I'm ready and farewell and stuff like that. Then the hatch was closed an I was completely alone in the absolute darkness. Now I grew a bit anxious, I'd think a reasonable reaction. Then I opened my eyes. The actual eyes of my body. And I saw the room I was in but couldn't move. This, in turn, was not scary but actually quite funny. After some trial and error I managed to take the control of my limbs and started to pace around the house and try out my body and it felt GOOD to move. Like this is what we are meant to do. Then a profound sadness came over me as I suddenly understood that every one of us are completely alone in our heads and can communicate only through words and gestures and so on. But never the full perfectly complete idea that we wanted to share. I cried for (what seemed like) a long time because I could never really REALLY tell my wife and children how much I love them. But I also understood that I must try anyway. To tell and to show it. This sounds a bit lame after this time when I write it down, but the effect on me was huge. After this experience I have focused a lot more on my family and I think I have a pretty good idea of what is really important. Little things don't bother me as much as before. I have felt myself significantly happier overall ever since this experience. More at peace, if you will. I have no doubt that my family has benefited of this as well. This is what I consider the most meaningful psychedelic experience of my life. So far."
psychedelics,"I had taken LSD with my partner. We listened to music for a little while and I went to go take a shower while I was still on the come-up. When I was in the shower I suddenly felt strange and disconnected from my body, and I kind of scalded myself with hot water. I started to remember some childhood memories. I've always known and remembered that I was a victim of childhood sexual abuse, but now other surrounding memories came back, of how I had felt and how I myself had punished myself after the abuse. I went back to my partner and I told him what had happened in the shower and I was able to tell him what happened to me as a child. I could go through it and feel it as if it was happening, with total clarity. But I felt safe, and after I had gone through it all I felt like I could really let it go, because now I had experienced it again without memory gaps and without fear and anxiety."
psychedelics,"I planned when to take mushrooms. I was home alone and I took 4 grams of P. cubensis. I don't know how much psilocybin the dose had but it was pretty strong. I have used mushrooms once before. I ate the mushrooms dried and I chewed them thoroughly and swallowed them with little water. After about half an hour of ingesting I started to feel very restless and nauseous. I felt like throwing up, but didn't have to. About 1 hour after ingesting I started to see visuals eyes open and closed. Nauseousness and restlessness disappeared and I felt excellent. I have never felt so good in my life.  During this 'peak' of the trip I felt giddy and multitude of thoughts kept racing through my head. Everything was bright and interesting. Maybe 2 hours after ingesting I had this sudden urge to go outside even though I had planned not to exit my apartment. So outside I went and it was amazing. Rain was falling down slowly and everything looked so impossibly beautiful. Smells and colours filled me and I couldn't stop smiling. I wanted to dance in the rain like a child but I was able to stop myself. I didn't want to appear anything out of the ordinary. In my mind I realised that it shouldn't matter how I express myself but social norms held me back so to speak. My thought processes were clearly different compared to when sober and my habit of worrying too much about trivial things were greatly lessened. I also encountered one dog when I was outside. It noticed me and I smiled at it. It felt like we had a connection and it felt like I haven't previously acknowledged how precious animals are. All in all going outside and feeling the rain and wind is the best feeling I have ever felt by far. I feel I will remember that feeling always. The visual effects of mushrooms started to disappear around 3 hours of ingesting but I still felt great for few hours more. The peak was shorter than I had hoped but it felt very long still. My perception of time was much slower. I didn't plan to have any big insights or introspection. I wanted to see what mushrooms do to me and maybe have more serious trips later. After the trip I feel like I have more energy in day-to-day life and I think that I hold myself back by worrying too much about everything and how others see me. So that's something to work on. I also appreciate nature more."
psychedelics,"The experience was a deepening of the work I've done through many years in order to heal trauma. Childhood as well as more recent. It was also used as attachment “healing”. The experience that of having a lot of resources in the nervous system, which brings up material which i cannot reach without. I was laying in my sofa, with a close friend who is a terepeuth and he was there only for me. After going through some somatic experience like movement for some hours I ended up with my arms around his neck, in similar way as my child does when he next connection. I was there for an hour, first crying a lot and then feeling relaxed and safe. Maybe more than I've ever had before. To me it was a feeling of a safe attachment. It also brought me weeks and months of integration, as well as seeing and mostly accepting that I'm probably have asperger, which is now soon a diagnose within the system for me. I find mdma to enable me to go in and out into the experience in one way. In another a lot of protection is lessen. This experience is with trained thereput from the us."
psychedelics,"Me and my beloved in our bedroom, listening to music after light dinner and some glass of prosecco. MDMA intake simultaneously. First we danced for a while, maybe half an hour ... after feeling of the drug starting to kick in, do not remember time duration, we lay in bed hugging each other. Kissing, hugging and cuddling, naked entangled in sheets and pillows ... for me the sheet starts feeling like soft gel and or as oil against my skin. Or warm breath. Breathing with my beloved synchronizes ... we move as if I, we, weigh nothing at all. On top, under, next to each other and as if we are merging ... Time is insignificant and as if everything is interwoven. Everything for me is just about dancing around in this experience. It feels as if I am floating around in a space of infinite softness, and that we are part of something larger, undefined. Gets thirsty and drinks water from a glass on the bedside table. Minutes, hours, later we are no longer lying down in bed but are fused as one body. The moment my beloved penetrates me, it feels as if my body softly disappears into his as if I am inside his skin. Inside his body. I don't exist anymore. And yet, I am aware of where and with whom I am. Slowly it happens, as I also experienced sometime later in a cannabis session, that my body is like a yoginis, soft, light and completely unobstructed, my bad knee is no longer there. Feels as if the body is malleable plasticity through space carefree. Many hours later at night, the afterglow softly returns to reality. In bed, needing to pee and very thirsty. The feeling afterwards is great gratitude, I cry a little, we cry for a while together. When he gets out of bed to go to the bathroom, it feels like I rest around him like a veil, like a morning mist, enveloped. All is forgiven. And everything is even."
psychedelics,"I chewed up the mushrooms slowly and then hiked from the parking lot, through the fort compound, and up to the old orthodox cemetery with wooden crosses. I started to feel the effects on my way there. I wanted to remain at the cemetery to sit and meditate, but I also wanted to be in the shade. I walked around in circles looking for shade, but there was none. This made me quite anxious. I settled on sitting on a bench in the sun. The sun felt hot on my head, and I was worried that in my state I would not be able to accurately assess this heat sensation and would possibly be putting myself at risk of heat stroke. Nonetheless, I sat for a while and enjoyed the stillness and solitude of the cemetery. Eventually, a couple of tourists pulled up in a car and found their way into the cemetery. This made me nervous and I did not like their vibe. I felt they were intruding on my 'sacred space'. Thankfully, they left after just a few minutes. I sat for a while longer and then got up and made my way down to the beach. The sea breeze felt nice, as did the cold ocean water on my feet. The sun did not feel as hot down by the water. I sat down on the sand and this is where my trip started to peak. I was a little wary of the other people on the beach, though thankfully there weren't so many, and nobody approached me. As I observed the people on the other end of the beach, it occurred to me that I could not perceptually determine how far away they were. But I knew this beach well, so I knew they had to be far away enough to not be a concern. Eventually I could not even determine whether there were other people on the beach. Or birds. Or insects, sea urchins, sea stars, or any of the other lifeforms that I had previously been marveling at. I felt like I was dissolving into the sand, becoming sand. It then occurred to me that I could not tell who or what was on the beach because I WAS the beach. And a beach has no needs and therefore no need for awareness of such things. A beach just is. So I just was. But upon having these thoughts I realized I must be starting to come back into my human form in order to be having thoughts at all. And with my human form came human needs: I needed to go find a toilet. But I did not feel human enough to get up and go do so. I sat in the sand for a while longer as I struggled to fully return to my human form. As I tried to will my being into my human body, I first felt like I was a mushroom, then a toad, and then a gnome. I found this amusing and laughed. To finally convince myself that I was a human and could function as one, I took out my phone and took a photo of the beach- a very human action. With that, I was satisfied. I got up and hiked back up to the fort compound. To my surprise, there were quite a lot of tourists visiting the fort that day. I found the restroom and hid there for a few minutes, feeling like it was a safe space where I could regain my bearings before heading back out into the people-filled world. I went into one of the fort's houses, into a room where I had spent many a night before. It was quiet and peaceful there. I felt tired and lied down on a bench and closed my eyes. I don't think I slept but when someone eventually came in and asked me if I was ok, I felt like I woke up from a nap. I sat up and rubbed my eyes, let the visitor know I was fine and just tired. I then got up and proceeded to walk around the fort compound, making a point of entering each building to soak in its atmosphere, letting myself partially 'become' the building as I had become the beach. I sang an old folk song in the empty chapel and this felt very satisfying. My trip started to wind down and I found my way back to the parking lot. I had a snack, a smoke of cannabis, and then enjoyed wandering around in the forest and on the ocean bluffs as I cried tears of gratitude, joy, and awe for the human existence I have been gifted with and all the beauty I get to experience. 8 hours after dosing, I felt sober enough and ready to begin the long drive home."
psychedelics,"March 19, 2022 a friend provided three and a half grams of Purple Mystic, a psilocybin mushroom. My knowledge of said species was simple. It is said to be one of the more potent magic mushrooms. The I was able to chew them down which presented itself with a texture and taste like a communion wafer (how appropriate) with a hint of mushroom flavor. We checked the time and it was 5:09pm. We went out for a cigarette about ten minutes later to give the shrooms time to work. And my first indication that something was up was when I apparently couldn't figure out how to use the elevator anymore. I attempted to slide my room key around what seemed to be a card reader. My friend smiled and pressed the button for me. I'm still unsure why my brain didn't know this. Well, actually, I am sure. It was the hallucinogen starting to work. My second indication the “medicine” was kicking in was outside smoking and I got into a giggle fit for no reason. I couldn't stop smiling. Here’s some events I recall after since things blurred and shifted, there’s no actual narrative. It was maybe by 5:30pm, and I couldn't settle down. I attempted to let it overcome me and, in the meantime, have sex. But my mind just wasn't on that. I was having trouble with reality and my brain wasn't having it. When I say I fought this hard, I mean I was super agitated and couldn't sit still. I kept getting up to drink water, orange juice or Coke. Lord of the Rings, Fellowship, was on and the picture got very purple. Everything was highlighted in purple. And when I matted my friend's hair, it would turn aqua or teal for a moment then go back to black.  There was a picture above us on the couch, three pictures in fact. They were of assorted spices and dishes. The one that caught my attention was a bowl containing what looked like colored sprinkles you'd put on cupcakes. And those began to spin clockwise. Some colored balls would flash in and out of existence. I began to feel fear and mentioned it to my friend. She took care of me, although tripping herself. I laid on her lap for comfort but could not settle down. I even noted I didn't like this. Then there was uncontrollable laughter. I was crying laughing. The image in my head was that of a black and white, balloon animal carnival, moving and bouncing like Steamboat Willie. They were beating big drums and playing assorted wind instruments like tubas and such. There was a ferris wheel and merry go-round. Then there was the caucus race right out of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Much of this experience was making impressions using familiar images to me. And I couldn't stop laughing. I thought I was scaring my friend but she reassured me I wasn't. Lord of the Rings was becoming too much stimuli (as much of everything was, thus my agitation). So we changed the channel to my friend's favorite show, SVU. And I heard it but then thought something else was on because the voices sounded like 1950s television.  At some point, I asked to switch over to music but even that was too much stimuli.  I was getting cold and went to get a blanket. I couldn't find an extra blanket and didn't seem to comprehend how to open the closet door. But once opened, I found the typical plastic hotel bag containing new bedding. And yet, I couldn't figure out which was the blanket and ended up grabbing what I think was a cushion one might put down if the bed was wet or had the potential to be wet. I swear my friend was with me as I saw her in the mirror but when I turned to see her, she wasn't there. She was in the living room area. We ended up in bed as it got dark and I was getting colder. I got my left foot sock on okay but couldn't reach my right foot. It was as if it was ten feet long. My friend tried to assist but in her trip, also couldn't help. Damnedest thing. I did eventually get that sock on. All of this wasn't impressing me and I thought this is the last time I do this. I was more panicked than enjoying the colors and spirals when I’d close my eyes. At times, I feared this would be permanent and I’d need hospitalization. I kept reminding myself this would, like any other drug, wear off soon enough. But with time slowing down, it was like the movie, Inception. I crawled onto the bed with my friend and couldn't lie down. I was on all fours and the most intense emotion took me over. I felt like I was holding on to the handle bar of a roller coaster going over the first hill. And I cried. I collapsed after and breathed it out. And here’s what I really wanna get down: While cuddling in bed, I got warm and took my socks off. Then on the right side of my head, I felt a warm, yellowish light form in the temple. Yeah, I felt the color. And could see it. And there was a hand in the center of it that was glowing yellow. And it pressed on my temple area (but on the inside, on my brain itself) and life images flashed. It kept dwelling on important people in my life. And the presence said this was what’s important and to protect it and treat it well. It didn't really speak. It was like telepathic messaging. With each image shown to me, the hand would press my brain. I’d see my kids and the hand would press it in, then other people and the hand would press. As if it were filing these into a file cabinet. Then when it appeared to be done, I recall saying, “Okay, I'll do that” once the lesson was over. And then there was peace. No more panic or fear. Just euphoria.  And everything was infantile. I felt like a child discovering the world new. I can only explain it as a death, then rebirth (that roller coaster) and then a motherly (anima?) giving instructions on what’s important now that I'm back. I then put on music and listed to the Smiths (of course) and it never sounded better. After a few songs, my Spotify algorithm kicked in and played other groups. The songs in this order were Making Plans for Nigel, Where is my Mind, Party of the Mind, Picture of Dorian Gray and the like. I don't believe in fate and think it’s just a coincidence but it felt like I had gone through a traumatic therapy session, had a breakthrough of understanding and now was in a recovery room being soothed by my favorite music. And then I came down. Not sure how long it took but reality was back, or at least coming back. I was prepared for just about everything that I experienced_ in that, I was up on what’s to be expected. So hallucinations, extreme colors, spirals, warmth, disorientation, strange worlds and high strangeness, fears and anxiety about loss of reality, and even the presence (to which I really didn't expect as I didn't think I had a high enough dosage). However, what has been lasting with me was the emotions. I understood the logical, expectations. There’s simply no way to expect the emotional feels that accompanies it. There are three things that make up your opinion on matters: Your knowledge of the subject, your personal experience with the subject and your emotional feel regarding the subject. I've always felt the emotional feel was the main driving factor regarding all subjects. So it was a pleasant (albeit, late processed) surprise to note how the emotional side of the experience was something unexpected. It stays with me."
psychedelics,
psychedelics,It's almost impossible to tell about the experience in foreign language.
psychedelics,"don't know how to start, because there is few of them, included to the same thing, same story. I was 15v and had known weed for a while, and tried ones microdose (0.5) mushrooms, in a way i knew what it is. The actual story first part We were hanging out quite casually, me, my best friend sam, ex friend henry, later on some tall dude (2m over) named pate (saw only that ones), one dumb kind silly friend jesse, and one idiot teutur. I was the youngest, others were few years older than me, we didn't planned it much, it's been long time so I don't remember before it too specific from how we end up to take those other than we took first at the apartment that my friend had. We planned to go for a lake, where was little campfire near it. Teutur did know where to get wood for it, so we did go get more wood when we got to the place, and the others stayed back the place. It was something half an hour, i took one 1800 micrograms? Nbome25, didn't know the difference before from those, and then after half an hour? One 150 micrograms lsd, according to my friend then at least. After hour? Over? Still didn't feel anything. So we were almost back there with teutur, and he gave me one more lsd, we were at the campfire, talked some shit, it was getting darker, had little buzzy feeling, nothing much, then everything changed. I was sitting, on the bench, calmly, felt in a way sober, reality intacted, then i heard helicopter from the left side quite close, and they i little bit startled from it, and went to look for it, seeing better what is it, people were what the fuck you doing? There isn't any helicopter, i was something like ten/twenty meters away from them, I did hear it clearly, they didn't, and i started to wonder what is this. I went to the other roads entrance, (two wooden wide plank road over beside the river.) Then they were like, there's nothing there, come back to here. Then i was like ok, and went to back for the bench. Then, from hearing the helicopter, until sitting back to again to the bench, everything happened exactly the same, and i was like ""ok? What is happening, started to little bit get nervous inside my head, that i was tripping that it didn't really just happend, or i remembered it differently, dejavu? Tried to reason it out for myself, figure it out what is was.  Because it started to loop, i wasn't control of myself which was really odd and frustrating in away, then the loop went to another screen, same place, same people, but kinda like i came with delay, and saw only some things that i was doing in the present, which was making it even harder to handle. I just popped in this reality, for a moments, i remember to stomb the fire mischievously, didn't know why and felt bad when i realized it after and people were yelling in i way, like what are you doing?! Stop that. I stopped, and then again i'm somewhere meanwhile, didn't see, nothing but the next time i'm running away from the tall dude, who was mad at me, i was again aware after that for a while again, and i was running for my life. He was accusing me throwing his liquor bottle to the lake, and in the moment i really didn't know it, i didn't see myself to be doing that in the presence, and couldn't have any knowledge from it. So i was like why is he accusing me for that and when he tried to grab me and i started to run, i got pretty far until he catches me and came with his knee straight to my left ribs, that already had mild injury, micro broken rib? Don't know the medical term to it. Anyway. I clearly remember the moment, when i ran, I didn't know why he was mad, he hitted with his knee, and in a way, i didn't feel it, and same time it numbed me little, hi was holding me in a choke hold from the back for a moment until i hitted my elbow to his ribs and took myself off from him and pushed him away and i was asking what the fack really is your problem? And he was yelling like ""oh what? Stop playing with me, you just threw my liquor bottle to the lake! So you get to get it back"" and i was like what the fuck no I didn't, what fucking liquor bottle!?"" I really didn't have the realization of that happening, but then he showed me where it is, and then i was like man, maybe i really did it. Next i started goofing around, doing some crazy shit, like crossing the river through it to the other side, which had little wooden bridge, next to the campfire, and next to me, literally, if i remember right, there was something, some reason, kind of dare to do it, from me or from them, there was urge to do it in a way, and it did make sense then. I didn't, and the other section was the other side from the bridge, that had big pipe over the river, something like three meters over the river that was little, and had rocks and low on water, so it would have been pretty dangerous to walk on it bare foot in that state. Again i was for a moment aware of the situation in a way, and i just felt doing it, people were shouting something little bit worried voice that come back from there, don't cross it from there. I didn't care, i just went, i started to be little bit sad too because i knew i have done something to upset people but still in away i enjoyed at the moment walking barefoot on the pipe. I didn't feel like there wasn't even a possibility me to drop from there, and I didn't, (glad i really had balance) even tho there was the risk. Then i got to the other side and finally calmed down for i while and little, actually yea after that i was watching the fire and it started to change appearance and maybe i saw something there, i don't know, before i stombed few times there, or was it a little moment mindfuck, still did it, then after i do i realised what the fuck is happening, and this goofy dumb kind guy asked me in a really weird way like ""are you fucked up, how fucked up are you? Called by my name and same with repeat and repeat, as someone would be replay it, and then my vision, started to go like the snowflake screen in an old tv background, when there is know channel. That started to happen after i heard that and then the goofy nice friend in a way mischievously, almost evil way started to laugh like a witch and then he roiled the campfire, with a stick and it looked like big spoon, and the fire started to change colour to in a way green and red. After that i didn't see other than that snow flake thing, hearing the voice echoing in my head creepingly replay of the repeat sentence that says im fucking fucked up, by my name. Next there was quite foggy, i visited a gate, i went to some dimension, didn't know, was hard to comprehend with it, with anything, the for a moment i saw this cross, that i have never seen anywhere in my life, it was fascinating, and and creeping at the same time. Cross with skeletons head that had crown, with endless spikes, mystic greend glow in the eyes, old wood the cross itself, and it was unrealistically wide, the mouth. Everything else is foggy from there, then i came back, but not in the same reality, not with the same knowledge, i woke up at the morning from the campfire, there was few friends left, goofy one was face down on the hard sand ground, next to campfire, mouth half full of sand/rocks, otherones sitting on the bench, i was coming back from it in a way, had some control again. I was back, but world size and time was different, felt like i went back in time, or/and was somewhere else, some details looked different. It felt like someone, something stuffed my head full of knowledge, and my world view, picture of the self, from everything almost was shattered across the world, million pieces, and felt more lonely than ever before. I tried to grasb everything that was running to my head, then it really hitted i went to my grandma's house, which was safe haven for me, little bit panicked about it, had to check it was still there, and the building was, everything just seemed different, more old, did see that it wasn't the same place, and then i really started to worry, where the fuck i am. I ran back to that place and there was only the goofy one left, i felt, like i was really alone, long far away from home, no coming back. I was talking with him and he didn't understand me well, and in some point left too. I was there the hole day, hottest days at summer, without shirt, it was in the lake, don't know why, i had only wet shoes without socks, swimming shorts, motorcycle helmet, and wet wallet + phone. In some point i was starting to burn, and i have only ones burned after that, being in thailand without sunscreen swinging and taking sun for Two weeks. I had this in my mind oddly clear that i needed ten reasons to get back, and i had only three, before I didn't even think about it, care about it in a way.  I was lost and just wondering around that same place, because all the people and the seen was looking and felt so unfamiliar, unreal, like i was stuck in the old version of the town, in a way felt timeless. In the shadows mosquitos were eating me alive and sun was burning, in one point when i was sitting on the bench, there walked by this random mother and maybe 7? Year old son and i saw from the side from my i that they stopped, because the boy was wondering that who was i, but why i remember this is that i heard him wondering what i have in hand, i had the helmet, and he asked it in a way that he really didn't have a clue what was that thing. The mother said that she don't know but lets let it be.. i startled inside and was like what? How they can't know what is this, and talked like i wouldn't be there, or i wasn't considered a being at least.. I had to drink from the lake, because i was so thirsty, in the late night evening, the henry and one girl found me from there, and looked really worried and heated. They were clad to find me tho, and they said that there was people looking for me, i was taken later to the teuturis place, to calm down. On the road there we were going through one place, that i knew, had a building before, and then i could just walk through, there was a road. I got to his place, and tried to sleep there, at the night, evening, i left there to be found.  Other things including the thing There is lot of things that affects to this, and this would continue much more. There is as much as i remember to that trip, there is lots of good trips after those few rough ones, the other one is where i really felt that i died, but the problem came when normally people are afraid to die, or not at all. I cared about it, but most of all i need to know it, and then i was left with the unknowing it. I was like that for years. I have always been awake, reality has forced me to be, after those it all had really magnified, i saw throught in a way things, people, life, nature, almost everything. It was hard to try convince myself that i am alive, or somewhere. I had dilemmas and paradox thoughts about it, it was always at backround for years. Am i somehwere in limbo? Is everything a trip and i just wake from hospital? Is this only a dream? Is anything this really happening or am i just imagine it all? How i know? How i get the proof? I always have been questioning everything, being curious to beings, life, nature, how everything works, the roots, death i started to question after my grandpa died, i was six. I didn't get more than ""he did go for a longer sleep"" that wasn't enough. Anyway, i have solved in the end, gotten conclusion about this in the end, pretty fast, but those took time, like years. I end up to conclusion that I can't take it anymore, and i need to accept that im here, and at least i am being, when im thinking, being aware of myself, and that's enough. I would like to share rest of the three, four of the trips, that includes to this, and the things i have found from all of these."
psychedelics,"I started alone in a dark room. After about 30 mins I started feeling a bit nauseous, then seeing some visuals (patterns, colors). The first feelings were a bit unsettling and I was anxious. Soon I felt a strong urge to go to the other room to be with the person I had as a ""safety back up"". As I entered the other room everything was super bright and beautiful and I felt deep happiness. I felt over all very good, safe and warm. I laughed a lot, cried a lot. I saw all these beautiful colors and lights. The other person looked beautiful and I felt strong commitment and trust with them. We talked for a couple of hours and my mind was unbelievably open. I can never truly describe the feeling, it was just something amazing and humbling even. I knew where and who I was and that it is my home, but I was on a completely different level. In a different world but within the same world."
psychedelics,All my anxiety disappeared and i was able to talk about my personal problems with my gf that i would never tell anyone. (Told my problems to my gf) i had little bit of hallucinations. My mind was so clear like never before. I was feeling so calm and like i couldn't be mad at anything like everything was like it should be this way.
psychedelics,
psychedelics,"My experience is actually more then one. It is both the most beautiful and life changing thing I have ever encountered and at the same time it was life changing in a very negative way. I took several mushroom trips in one year after I had one trip in which I flew out of my body into space. I heard a voice (for the first time) in space that told me to let go of my past and that mental health issues are misunderstood on earth, they are actually spiritual encounters with a world we deny existence of. I started having all sorts of strange but interesting psychedelic experiences. I felt good about the experiences and at that time felt I was growing. Then I took bufo, which changed me completely. I wrote about the experience just after it happened:  The Shaman opened my Heart and said you're a strong female warrior. I saw a pattern closing in. Then there was nothing, is this what it feels like to die? My Heart beat stronger then I could imagine, It was a porthole between my consciousness and my body, my body was not present in that moment of no time and no substance but oneness. I was one with everything and at the center of everything there was The Centre, The Source. I was one with the most purest form of energy, which was every emotions, except of the negative emotions which seemed not to exist in Heaven where I felt one with Love. At the core of His eye was The most purest energy of gold impressions that continuously flowed into swirls reminiscing Mosques, Churches and Buddhist and Hindu temples but more vibrant and pure then the interpretations on earth. A voice sung about our pain that was felt, it spoke in a language older then we are aware of existing but I understood it. A powerful and emotional song provoking thoughts of a holy hymn that lead to inspire religious songs on earth. The song awakened an absolute devotion, I knew it was The Truth. It told me how we had forgotten who we are and had forgotten that we are made of the same energy that can realize our thought into existence by believing in them. We are creators and think things into existence but because we forgotten where we come from we are creating from a forgotten place, a place of fear which is causing devastation on our planet. Resulting in traumatic memories creating even more fear, this fear is saturated by our media. To turn around the devastation on earth we have to trust in a better future and feel with The Heart and not our head the change that will be brought from this trust. We need to be careful with our thoughts as they can create truth. When I got back to the earth, I felt in my heart that who spoke to me in heaven was God, that feeling never left me.  Shortly after these experiences I started hearing voices very frequently. It got to a point that I couldn't sleep anymore and things started to become very dark as well. I think the psychedelics opened a door to a world that exists parallel to our world and witgehandschoend world there is a lot of different energies some a pure and good but others are evil. In my experiences I encountered both. There is so much that happened in the months that this was happening. I've written it all down but it’s not very well written because I wrote it when I was traumatised by the experiences. If any of it would be of any use your more then welcome to contact me.

psychedelics,"The experience under the substance involved a lot of questioning on the meaning of life and death, with (as usual when I take ayahuasca) a lot of emotional ups and downs during the session, which was spent with me lying down in a house during the retreat. It is at the end of the session (about 7 hours after ingestion) that I went out outside, and experienced what can be best described as a transcendental experience. There was tremendous wind on that day and the sun was about to rise, and the whole thing had a profoundly surnatural feel. The revelation involved the understanding of how lucky and grateful we humans can feel of being alive, because there is pretty much nothing else out there, out of the earth we inhabit. This world is a genuine miracle, and it is very obvious, EVEN when adopting a rational / materialistic mindset. This was an incredibly relieving realization. Suddenly I realized how I had perceived the world as a glass half empty, whereas it had been half full all along. All my prior beliefs, that life was mostly about suffering, that nothing made sense and that there should always be something to complain about all that toxic beliefs instantly disappeared. Since then, I have never perceived the world in the same way ever again. I have become more tolerant of people oriented towards feelings, people, and much more appreciative of existence overall. I can appreciate beauty more easily. I pay more attention to other people's feelings."
psychedelics,"This experience took place at home in my bedroom on Saturday morning after a 5 days of fast (a guided, planned fast with water only). I've been meditating everyday during the past week after going to school. I prepare my room, close the shutters so it was almost completely dark. There was my parents and little brother at home, knowing what I was going to and open to it. I'm deaf and I wear glasses, I remove it to get less as possible stimulations. About 9h45 am, I ate 3,2 gr of Cubensis B+ and lie on my bed. About 11 am, after strongs physical effects as my body shaking, feeling cold and quick intense visual distortions and hallucinations, I started experienced what I believed to be a ego dissolution. I wasn't aware anymore of my physical body and felt non duality. There was a moment when ""I"" felt sucked by this current and being integrate part of this ""all"" (seeing colorful, like rainbow, patterns). Feeling of being breath / vibration / movement.  There was no more distinction between ""I"" and what I described precedently and coming next. ""I"" was seeing colorful patterns that took differents forms like an inverse tree, giant centipede that were in perpetual movement and seem like crossed by vibrations, currents that ""I"" was perceiving as energy. There was nothing else, just a black background. At some point, patterns reverse the way it went and slowed down until it stopped a few instants (at this moment, I got strong positive feeling of born), before it reverse it's way again and restart moving as before. During this whole experience, feeling of love, kindness and fullness. I've been able, at some point (don't remember when precisely) to stand up to drink at the bathroom. I was like floating in space when walking to the bathroom. Then I've moved back to lie again on my bed and got back into the experience (colorful patterns) _ it was about 12h30 I believed. About 14h30 pm, I've no more hallucinations and I was me again, ego conscious in my body. Then I started to have cycled anxious thoughts, because I was looking for an explanation to this experience that I qualified of transcendent. I took sometime to discuss with my little brother who studied science of religion and this helped me to get out of those anxious thoughts. I had dilated pupils until 18h pm. The day after, on Sunday was my 1st day of realimentation after fast. It went well. On Sunday, I still had at some moments the feeling of perceiving stimulations outside my body, like if the zone of perceiving stimulations (felt like my consciousness) was 30cm around my brain. I wrote about this experience on a specific forum, it helped me to integrate. The moments after and days following, I felt great, peacefully and positive."
psychedelics,"The reason I chose this experience, while not necessary the most profound, is because it was the one that led to my marriage. My mountaineering partner/landmate and I were on a mountaineering trip and were 15 miles upriver from the nearest trail. We took MDMA together (it was his first time) and spent the day connecting with each other, with the land, and with ourselves. It opened an emotional and cuddly (not sexual) dimension to our friendship, which eventually evolved into a romantic relationship (over the next year). We would not be together today if it had not been for that experience. The experience was total bliss and brought about a feeling of being completely at home with one another and in the mountains. (That said, we were charged by a mountain lion many times early the next day so went very quickly from total bliss to total terror...)"
psychedelics,"Took LSD with two friends at a music festival and even though (or maybe because) the environment felt really unsafe I started dissociating. At first I was just perceiving my friends as funny looking and slowly I also started noticing that my perception was changing as I was able to see was i believe was the matter moving around. I had to sit for a minute, a stranger started talking to me so I got up and perambulated . Slowly, as I got more and more into my own head I was able to feel all sorts of thing. I was thinking about my loved ones when it hit me and I claimed I understood everything. But when it was time to explain, I didn't have the words. I got an hallucination picturing the drug in a puzzle form that completed the night sky, as though it was the answer. The rest is pretty blurry but I learned a lot about myself, what makes me happy and how I want to be perceived by others. I was so drained after a few hours that I slept."
psychedelics,Light Love and absolute surrender… a literal swim in the ocean of nirvana.
psychedelics,"It was my first time trying mushrooms 26 years ago. There were 5 people, one of whom was my ex-boyfriend and one was my childhood friend. The others were just a little familiar. We learned about the safe dosage through a friend whose father was a homeopath. We picked the mushrooms ourselves.  I remember how we waited them to work, and the odd feeling when they did. The effect was initially so small, that I thought I was imagining it. It was actually a relief when it finally worked properly. I think that the beginning and the end of the effect are always the worst.  We were at our friend's home, his parents were at their summer cottage. We all lived with our parents that time, we were only 16-19 years old.  At one point we ran out of cigarettes, so we all went to buy them. We walked hand in hand and felt like we were at our own little bubble. Then we arrived to the bar, and our friend ""Pekka"" went inside to buy them. Then he came back laughing, and told that he had been unable to speak, because he had been laughed so much. I don't remember how we finally got the cigarettes.  What I remember about that night, is that we had fun, love and felt connected to the world and to each other. We felt that we were part of the mycelium that connected us. (Even today i feel that we are connected to each other, even though we haven't seen for over a decade.) (And still today I feel connected to nature. I wasn't surprised when I heard that trees communicate with each other. I believe that because we are so open when we eat Lsd or mushrooms, we pay attention to details. There are so much we don't normally get in touch with.)"
psychedelics,"This experience took place when I was 24. I had some previous experiences with LSD and psilocybin. I had never took more than one hit of lsd (~120ug) before. After month of planning the perfect night arrived when I was alone, in a good state of mind and I had nothing to do for the next day. I dosed the lsd (200-250 ug / 2 tabs) at evening. I proceed to meditate while waiting it to come up. My plan was to meditate and dive deep into my mind. During the come up I was restless and my mind was racing. I felt like I made a mistake and I got anxious over the thought of getting out of control high. I kept calming myself and tried to keep meditating and suddenly wave of euphoria washes through my body and I forgot all the anxious thoughts. At this stage I just wanted to lay down and laugh. I felt so good about myself, better than I have ever felt. First time ever I looked up to myself and I realised that all my insecurities are foolish and I can work through them. In the mirror I saw a beautiful human being full of life, when sober I just see a loser. I realised that we are all one and we have to empathize one another and treat all life with respect. This really opened me as a person and it had huge impact on what I want from life. It changed me from sad to more positive and it showed me life is beautiful. At this point I had all sorts of fractal patterns flowing behind my eyelids, it got to a point where I only saw white. I was pure energy, pure bliss. I had no contact on my body anymore. After a while I got back to my body and I continued my trip by listening to music and dancing and by going to walk."

psychedelics,"I my long term partner had left me about three weeks ago because i had cheated her. Felt awful about her, me and us. So when my friend asked me to come take shrooms I decided that I will use this opportunity to reflect what had happened while tripping. My doings were so painful to me, I had serious problems even thinking about it. We always but effort to the setting and preparing mentally. We turned of phones, did a loooong good playlist, talked about what to expect and what to do if someone feels bad. So the set was good. Shrooms kicked really hard and I just dropped on my mattress on the floor. My mind was wondering and I had strong visions about desert, camels and super mario to name a few. Eventually I got back in helm and steered my thought to my painful break up and my habit of cheating. It wasn't painful or scary to look at the whole thing. It was like all that was a 3d object that I could look from different angles. At the end I came to revelation that love is the ultimate importance in life. I had had that before while on shrooms. Anyway, the pain was drastically reduced after that and I started feeling positive feelings again my everyday life. It had a profound effect in my immediate life but also gave me confidence that painful things can become less painful. That you can survive. I lost my wife to cancer few months ago and I do know even now that this unimaginable pain I am feeling now will turn into something less painful. I think that trip has something to do with it."
psychedelics,"I have had 2 very distinct meaningful experiences with psychedelics... 1)MDMA with a therapist- for the first time in my life I could see and experience that I, as a neglected and bullied child, was just as lovable as any other child of that age. Moreover, I could feel for the first time that my parents where really delighted with me as a baby, and for the first time I could really forgive them for their neglect and abandonment. NO amount of rational understanding or therapy has ever been able to do that for me. I could also feel and experience that they had suffered enormous lack of safety, just as I do-thereby increasing my empathy for them. After the session, the relationship with my father (which has been very hard since my teenage years), who had deceased just 6 weeks before the session, seemed completely resolved (and it stayed like that).  2- psilocybin in a retreat setting. Very different experience and almost entirely physical. I was shaking for hours and needed to make gestures and movements. I am a dancer at professional level and yoga teacher but never thought of myself as particularly creative or artistic. However, during this session, after shaking for a few hours, I started to dance. Of course there was no decision to do so, it just happened. It was one of the most amazing experiences in my life. My body found amazing news pathways to move. Cannot describe with words. Maybe some realization of ""this is me""- I am, somewhere at my core, a dancer with a need to express and feel my body."
psychedelics,"I have suffered from depression on and off for all of my adult life, partly because of 8 years of childhood bullying and the hyper-alertness and self-consciousness it caused, and partly due to work-related stress and body dysphoria due to obesity (""emotional eating""). I have been on antidepressants since 2011 (bupropion).  Leading up to my psychedelic experience in January of 2019, my mother had died about 8 months before, and I was dealing with grief. I had been drinking alcohol too frequently since about 2015 - not quite to the point where I would consider it an addiction, but there was definitely some psychological dependence there, and if I had kept drinking I would have been an alcoholic today, I'm quite sure.  I had read about early studies that showed the potential for psychedelics as antidepressant treatments, and went pretty deep on the scientific literature on the subject, reading about the default mode network, dendritic arborization, potential neurogenesis/plasticity effects, the studies done on cancer patients dealing with grief, etc - so I was quite confident that psychedelics could potentially help me with my depression.  Since psilocybin is prohibited where I live, I decided that the best path for me would be to travel to Amsterdam, and to treat myself - I couldn't afford to go to a retreat at the time.  I read about psychedelic experiences numerous places - not just the scientific literature, but also Michael Pollan's book, various forums, etc. I took all the precautions I could, and tried to prepare myself well. I wrote down my intentions, detailed ""flight instructions"" (if you see a door, go through it, if you see a monster-go meet it, etc), and prepared a playlist of very calming music, two mindfulness meditations to listen to during the takeoff phase, etc.  I took 15 grams of a magic truffle called Galindoii - according to the sources I could find the most potent of the Psilocybe sclerota - and used a process called ""lemon tek"" in order to pre-convert some of the psilocybin to the active metabolite psilocin - I basically mashed the truffles in lemon juice and let them steep for about 10-15 minutes before I took them. I had been fasting for about 18 hours, since I had heard that this could help prevent nausea for some.  I was in a quiet and comfortable hotel room, had the curtains drawn to make it dark and cozy, and had my computer at the ready with the playlists that I previously mentioned prepared.  Upon taking the truffles, I lay down and started the music at a low volume and the guided mindfulness meditation slightly louder. There was a 15 minute body-scan at first. I was nervous, but tried to still my mind. I remember toward the end of the body-scan that I thought to myself that I had never been as good at keeping focus during that exercise before.  The next mindfulness exercise started automatically, and it was a ""loving kindness"" routine that had me thinking about my closest friends and relatives, thinking about my love for them, and also turning that same kind of loving kindness toward myself. Since I was grieving the loss of my mother, I had many thoughts about her during this meditation, but also my daughter, my wife, one of my brothers, my father to some extent, etc. It was a very meaningful meditation for me, and I could actually feel that sense of loving kindness for myself toward the end - as if I was a young child, worth protecting and loving - feelings that are almost impossible for me to conjure up in everyday life.  During this quite long meditation, I could gradually feel the effect of the psilocybin kick in - my sense of time was altered, and I could feel my awareness of my body start to disappear, unless I purposely ""searched"" for my foot or my thigh, I had no proprioception. I was also finding it hard to concentrate on the meditation. I turned it off almost as it was about to end, which is why I know that this was at the 40-45 minute mark.  I turned up the music, and let the experience claim me. --------------------------------------------- My most vivid recollections from the experience were the following:  There were parts of it where all of my proprioception was gone. There was no sense at all of having a body - but I could quite easily feel my body if I searched for the impression - it was just that my mind wasn't integrated completely.  The most difficult thing to explain and put into words is the very strong realisation that ""I"" was not having these experiences. My sense of self was gone. My personal history, my frame of reference, everything that makes me an integrated person - all of that was gone, and all that was having the experience was ""a consciousness"", not a ""me"" or ""I"". So when I say henceforth that ""I"" had certain thoughts, that is just because that's how our language works. It's very hard to speak of there being a consciousness having a particular experience, without giving that consciousness the 1st person pronoun ""I"".  During one part of the experience, ""I"" was focused on my breathing and the music. That music was very slow, with lots of long, slow transitions between different timbres and chords, and the notes had colours and texture and shape. ""I"" existed in a void and the notes and chords were shapes, like multicoloured strings and loops of plasma-yarn - it's hard to put into words exactly. And the awareness of breathing was suddenly there. I remember thinking that my breath was so incredibly slow. It felt like a single breath took minutes or maybe hours, and in the space between two breaths, ""I"" experienced many tonal shifts of the music. Like I somehow perceived music so incredibly fast the body I was in was working in slow-motion by comparison.  ""I"" floated in that vast, dark, endless void for an incredibly long subjective time. I was filled with awe and wonder, love and a sense of oneness with everything. I remember reflecting, because ""I"" could think quite coherent and advanced thoughts, that this must be what people with temporal epilepsy who have mystical experiences where they are in touch with what they call ""God"" must be experiencing. I was experiencing what someone could describe as a religious experience of unity with ""God"", if they had that frame of reference and a prior belief. I don't, however, so I thought of the experience as a state of my brain. I was somewhat surprised that I could think such coherent thoughts in the midst of a psychedelic trip.  During one part of the experience, I revisited the people that the loving-kindness experience made me think of. I saw vivid images of my mother in various situations, and I wept and let myself feel all the grief I had inside. (That was the first time since her death that I had fully let myself feel that grief - I had met it only intermittently and mostly ran away from it, figuratively speaking). I also saw images of my nearest friends and family and felt the incredible love and affection I feel for them.  I saw a specific cat - my neighbour's cat, who came to visit my family often. It had recently died, and I grieved for it during the trip.  And then I got an epiphany - it's hard to use any other word, because it was so strong and vivid and convincing that I just knew it to be true, and I still know it to be true today, with a level of confidence I don't have about anything not-easily-provable in my life: ""I"" am the same as that cat.  Not the person that is my integrated personality and history, but the ""I"" that was having the psychedelic experience. That pinpoint-sharp conscious experience that I was having, that I can only speak of as ""the consciousness"" is the same in all conscious beings. It's just the property of having subjective qualia. In a mammalian brain, that consciousness is dulled by all the sensory input, all the internal noise in the brain, etc, so it isn't as sharp and pinpoint-like in everyday life, but the basic property of having a consciousness is the same for all of us. We are all the same. We are all one.  And then that consciousness that we all have our own copy of, as it were, happens to follow a certain path in life, accumulates different experiences, etc- which shapes us into the thought patterns and behaviours that make us individuals.  It was a VERY strong experience of oneness. I felt I could suddenly generalise the love I feel for my closest family and friends to all beings who have subjective experience. We are all worthy of love and kindness and consideration. We all suffer - and we all deserve not to.  With this came the realisation that some of us live lives full of adversity, which I conceptualised as ""sharp"" experiences - ""kiki"" experiences - all pointy, cold, uncomfortable and unpleasant. Others live lives where there is more of pleasantly comfortable experiences - ""bouba"" experiences, warm ones. The ""kiki-bouba distinction"" is something I didn't think of during the trip, but that came to me after, when I tried to explain what I learned, but I had the realisation during the trip. We all try to navigate our inner gradients of reward vs punishments, bouba and kiki.  For a while, I was lost in a memory of being an infant - long before I had command of language and long before I had a distinct sense of self. I remembered some toys I had in my stroller, and that I looked up at. I remembered looking up at a lamp as I had my diaper changed. My earliest childhood memories, from before my brain was integrated. That state of consciousness must be somewhat akin to what a cat has, I thought.  Toward the end of my experience, as I was regaining my sense of having a body and generally integrating the parts of my brain that had been disintegrated, my sense of being a male creature with a sexuality directed toward females came back to me. I Remember a feeling of purpose and warmness in my loins - an urge to penetrate and to be embraced and to form a sexual union with another person. I remember seeing a woman not unlike Venus of Willendorf - larger that I'm attracted to normally, but she somehow represented ""female"" and ""femininity"" to me. I longed to be with her - and she gradually morphed into my wife, and I felt that longing to be with her.  The come-up from there on was quite fast I think. I was back, and I was an integrated person again.  ---------------------------------------------------- The first thing I did after, when I was sure all my intellectual faculties were back, was to phone my brother to tell him I love him and miss him.  I knew that he needed to hear that someone cared about him.  I also knew I wanted to live. I wanted to experience the rest of my life. I no longer wanted to die - I wanted to have closer ties with my friends and family, and experience every day to its fullest. Things were deeply MEANINGFUL to me for the first time in about 20-25 years."
psychedelics,"It was a planned therapeutic session with MDMA with the trained and experienced facilitator who I trusted. We met in the morning in his therapeutic room with an altar and mattress for me. We started the session with a substance as a ritual, with the ceremony with incense and pray. Then I verbalized my intention/my question to work with during the session: Why I'm not able to fell in love with anybody who I´ve met or am dating or hanging out with? Why, when I'm in a relationship, don't feel that my boyfriend is the right one and after some time I break up with him? Why I feel some communication problems in the relationship? Why I'm not able to express myself properly? Why I'm not able to open myself to him? Why I feel some kind of fear? Is that a fear of responsibility or fear of taking something seriously? But on the other hand, I'm kind of person who prefers serious relationships, but not with anybody, it has to be somebody special for me, some kind of my soul mate, but I'm losing the hope to meet somebody like this… Then I took the substance – 100 milligrams of pure MDMA and laid down. When I felt it started to work, I felt an extreme cold, although I was covered in a thick warm blanket, I was freezing to death and started to feel really really bad and anxious. I woke up from the mattress and went to sit down next to the heating and I put more blankets on me, because I needed to feel something warm, or otherwise I was going to die. I was sitting attached to the heating and feeling the extreme pain and vanity, I was feeling that my existence is so useless and I was suffering a lot, really deep inside me. I didn't know what to do, how to resolve it, everything was so pointless, my life was completely meaningless_ I didn't see the way out of it. I was so deep in this feeling, my head was full of pain and pressure, but I had no thoughts, I was so in my head, but there was nothing there, absolutely nothing, I mean the thoughts. I was just a feeling being, but suffering being, abandoned, alone, unsupported being. It was a hard time, I was feeling an enormous grief and weight of everything on me. I was feeling that I had to throw away something from my head, but the feelings, not thoughts. I started to cry and exhale deeply. Then I was asked to have 60 milligrams more, because it was a time of the addition. I accepted because I felt I needed it, although I had a hard time, but I felt that I was in a safe place with the sitter who I trusted, so I could allow myself to let go of the control and go absolutely into the experience. Then I was asked to move from the heating to the mattress because when I was sitting there, I was blocking something. I felt that should move from the heating, but I wasn't able to move – I mean I was able to move physically, but not psychically. After a while I moved from the heating to the mattress, but to leave the heating was the hardest decision of my life and it took me a lot of effort. But I found a courage and made it. Then we started a body work – I was pushing with my legs against the body of my sitter, then also with my jaws, I was crying and I put all my energy in it. It was like fighting against something and pushing something outside of me with all my energy and effort possible. After a while, I was really exhausted and I started to feel a huge relieve. I was lying down on my back and I started to feel a warm inside me. First, it appeared in a sacral spine and lower back and I started to feel so happy. I was lying on my back, feeling the pleasant warm, and had my legs upward, so I was, literally, in the position of happy baby, and I was feeling literally as a happy baby. The sitter was sitting close to me and I hugged him as a baby's hugging its parent. In this moment I was feeling the true, pure love. It was the best and most powerful moment of my life, it was a total bliss, I was unconditionally loved and I felt it so much and so deep inside me. I felt satisfied and I was crying a little bit, but it was tears of happiness, relieve and reconciliation. I felt that I had discovered America, because I had discovered myself, my deepest self, my soul. I felt an eternal love, bliss, happiness, compassion and my reason to be here in this world. I felt reborn, because I was reborn. I was love. I was enough just like I was. Then the warm went to belly, I felt my belly button pulsing and then, the warm moved upper and upper to the chest and to the heart. I was very focused on this warm feeling and was with it on its journey. Then it moved to the neck and throat, I really felt it in the throat and in my ears and in the head as well – it finally ended up at the top of my head. My head was hot, burning, I felt that I had a fever, but it wasn't the same feeling as at the beginning, it was a fever or joy or maybe enlightenment. I also had warm hands and I really felt to take my sitter´s hand to give him some of this warm. I laid on my side and held his hand in mine and I was feeling this nice lovely warm. I felt so moved, so exhausted and so reconciled and I felt that the journey there and back again was over. It was challenging and healing journey and it was done. I went home and went to sleep immediately. The next day was a little bit in a blur, in a dream. I thinking about the experience and I started to cry spontaneously a few times during a day. In the morning, I went to yoga class in my favorite yoga studio. I felt a little bit dizzy and tired, so I was wondering if I would be able to practice and the truth was that it was quite hard for me, because I felt so weak, but on the other hand, I hadn't been so mindful and so focused in the yoga practice never before. In final relaxation, savasana, I felt that warm, that warm feeling which I knew, in the lower belly and solar plexus. O consider myself as a part of a psychedelic community, I have some experience with the classical psychedelics, always in therapeutic/self-discovery/ceremonial/indigenous setting and I really trust in their therapeutic potential. I also know that I have some love and attachment issues from my childhood due to my mother's behavior, so I definitely wanted to have a professional therapeutic MDMA session and I knew, more or less, what to expect from the experience, in general. But the experience itself was much more I could have ever before expected or imagined. It was so much about the feelings and fully mindful living them. It was kind of challenging miracle, it was exhausting and hard, but beautiful and marvelous at the same time. I'm so fascinated with what happened to me and feel a special hope, some kind of new life energy, power or agency. It was definitely very meaningful and life-changing experience for me. I got to know what the love is – the true, unconditional love full of compassion and affection. I got to know how to see the world with my heart. It was the transformation of myself and I am very grateful for that. I am healed and I was the healer."
psychedelics,"New year's eve 2011, early in the evening, quite at the beginning of the party I ingested sugar cube with 100 mcs of LSD. There was a group of about 10 friends, and everyone was consuming beer, cannabis and amphetamines, some had e.g. magic mushrooms, opioids or misc narcotic medication with them. Everyone had ecstasy tablets. I was the only one who was in possession of LSD. I had been drinking and doing speed most of that day, so I started my actual psychedelic experience with LSD. Quite soon I felt something in my spine, and as this was the first time I did LSD, I was frightened. I had to hold hands with one of my best friend when the LSD started to rise. Soon after I plateaued I can't remember details very well, but I remember being somewhat bored, so I decided to smoke some cannabis. Before that, I remember convincing myself while talking to my mirror image in the bathroom mirror, that it would be fine even if I don't deal with my problems (I was going through a break-up from my girlfriend, I had to move away from the apartment in which we lived together, and I also had quite bad substance abuse problem) right now, so that they can wait for another day. I knew that smoking cannabis while tripping could possibly make me lose my sanity, but I did it anyway. Alone in my friend's bathroom I smoked a bowl, but nothing happened immediately. Then when I joined other people, sat down and looked around I saw visuals in which the head of my good friend started to bubble away. It was so ridiculous sight I couldn't do anything but laugh. After that memories go blurry, but I remember that we all ate ecstasy, and that there was a typical feeling of unity among all of us friends. When I woke up the next afternoon or so, I wasn't even hung over or anything, nor did I had any bad after effects that are typical to ecstasy and alcohol. I had a really serene and positive state of mind for days, even though before that my default state of mind was usually crippling anxiety. Summa summarum, in my time I have had wilder hallucinations from psychedelics and wilder cocktails of drugs than with this experiment, but this was somehow the most curing, the most positive experience ever."
psychedelics,"I was lying on a beach of a tropical island with one friend. He was sober. We were watching the sunset which was quite beautiful. There were some clouds which started to turn into faces. I felt really comfortable and when the experience continued even ecstatic sometimes. Like it was sometimes almost difficult to breath because life just felt so good. The faces didn't really say anything but I knew they were good and on my side. At some point I walked into the water and it felt amazing on my skin. Just regular walking felt really good – I could enjoy every step. I had bought a beer earlier but forgotten about it during the experience. When I noticed it and tasted it, it also tasted amazing. When it got dark we decided to take our bikes and go back to the hotel. Biking during the experience felt also amazing – just like flying slowly through the air. At some point I stopped to listen some show where people were drumming. It was only drums but I was mesmerised by it and stopped to listen for some time – I don't know how long exactly. Then my friend came back for me and we went to the hotel. At our room the walls were breathing and I still felt really good, but the experience was starting to wear off. Then we went for a dinner and I was having this afterglow, but wasn't seeing or feeling anything extraordinary anymore. I sweated a lot. The whole experience lasted around 4 hours.  (After the experience I have been getting these moments of joy and ecstasy where it's kind of difficult to breath in a good way even without taking any psychedelic. These experiences were quite common after the trip, like few times a month, but they have been getting more seldom after that. Now they are not very frequent anymore, but sometimes I can get into a similar mood of awe and wonder just when I'm sober. I think psychedelics helped to unlock these way of being.)"
psychedelics,"From the start of the trip i felt strong anxiety. I was trying to clear my mind but this purple snake was like stalking me. As i was its prey. The snake was in my thought and when i opened my eyes i was sure it was somewhere close, like behind corner or under my sofa ready to strike. After some time i decided to give up and let the snake fill my mind. I closed my eyes and came face to face with the snake. Snakes appearance was between realistic and cartoon like (like from some disney movie from childhood) the eyes were yellow and skin was purple. I went on this journey in my mind. I saw some young girl who was sad and alone. The girl had her own purple snake but it was small and young as the girl was. I watched as the girl crew up and so did the snake consuming her more and more as the time went on. The girl now as an adult fell in love with man she had met. (Man did not have snake with him) They got 2 kids one girl (older one) and one boy (younger one). But when the boy was born he came in to this world with his own purple snake. After this i opened my eyes and the meaning of the story became clear to me. I was the boy born in the end and the girl from the beginning was my mother, and the snake was like curse of depression and bad luck. I was crying a lot. I was understanding better why my mother was like she had been and i also felt sorry for myself and things i had gone through. I went in to the bathroom and saw myself in mirror but i looked young (5-6 years old). For some time i watched myself in the mirror crying and telling my young self that all is going to be good and that he would survive from all the bad things to come. After some time the reflection in the mirror was normal. I was still sad but felt this strong sympathy and love for myself. I wrote notes from the trip for my psychotherapy and went out side in close by forest to enjoy nature and sunlight."
psychedelics,"HOURS of intense sensory experiences. The best and worst feelings, emotions and thoughts that I can ever remember having Mystical connection with the universe, gnosis, enlightenment Zen or whatever you want to call a comprehension of the deep divine fabric of reality."
psychedelics,"I realized that someone or something was observing me. I asked myself who it was. It responded, ""who do you think it is?"". I felt a sensation telling me that it might me God. I responded ""God"". It responded back to me saying ""Niin"" (Finnish word for approving without stating it). The we commenced in a conversation, in Finnish. God told me that we meet because we are facing similar problems. I told that i could not have any problems of that caliber. God showed me 2 vision. One where witches were flying around and where superstition and magic was creating horror on the planet. Another vision was the vision of young people being misled to hell, on a path disguised as success. I realized that the world is missing true role models for the youth. Now God told me to fix these problems. I told that it is impossible for me to do such great things. God told me that it is not impossible as i was him/it. I responded that i am not him or god, and that the suggestion is impossible. After this i saw a vision of me doing everything in my power to prove to god that i was not him, until i came to the realization that it is impossible that i am not God. Now after this the experience took a break, and i returned to my normal state of mind. Now i was wondering what happened. I still felt unease about the mission, and could not see any ways of implementing it. Then the voice returned saying. Remember, you can ask anyone for help in this mission. Then another voice emerged saying, or you can ask ""anything"" of help. Then something really surprising happened. I came back to my normal state of mind, although my sofa seemed to be alive. A tentacle grow from the sofa, and a face appeared in the end of the tentacle saying ""Remember, you can ask anything of help"". Later i realized that the other voice was the Universe speaking to me. Asking for help is still hard for me, but since that experience, almost 10 years ago, my life changed, i have learned a lot about myself, god and the universe. Been participating in scientific and metaphysical studies, writing articles, and joined the Galileo Comission to find meaning to my life."
psychedelics,"I was given a dose of LSD in blotting paper by my friend as I sat on a hill above the sea on beautiful cloudless sunny day. After a short while I felt waves of energy flowing through me initially located in my lower abdomen which gradually spread up my torso (spine?). I felt bliss and started to laugh with a freedom and joy I never experienced before or since. Gradually I became awake and felt like I had an understanding and knowledge about the nature of everything. I felt serene and that I would like to stay in this state for ever and did not even consider that it would cease. I wanted around this beautiful place with blue sky and the sea below me. the cry of the seagulls were like a song to God. This state of awareness and knowing lasted for several hours . I felt complete and more alive than I had ever done before. I felt like I was home and never wanted to leave and why should it ever end? As darkness fell I looked into the vast dome of the heavens and behold all the stars in their glory. I never wanted this experience to end but then after about 10 hours I gradually felt the experience diminish and felt a sense of loss. It was the greatest experience of my life and has had a profound effect on my life from then. I have endeavoured to get back to that state by taking psychedelics for a number of years but never quite the same and then subsequently through living a spiritual life though having to live ""in the world"" and deal with my ego and psychological issues and relationships."
psychedelics,A feeling of that there was no way to achieve real happiness in life.
psychedelics,"I was in Amsterdam and took magic truffles. I was with my girlfriend, we had been together for half a year or so, and we went to the Rijksmuseum as I had been told the paintings looked really nice when under the influence of psilocybin. I really looked forward to have this experience and having some cool visuals as I had been told it was something really special. I didn't however feel much during the museum visit and was a bit disappointed. My girlfriend was actually quite relieved that I didn't have a strong experience as she was somewhat worried about the whole thing. So after the museum I decided that I should boost the experience with cannabis. So we walked to some shady coffee house and I started wondering what I should get. But as I was in the coffee house wondering what I should get I saw the look in my girlfriends eyes. The worry in her eyes really hit me and I instantly decided I didn't actually want to get cannabis to boost.  After this we walked through the city for a while and after some time the emotions just poured right out of me. I cried and explained to my girlfriend what I was feeling and how sorry I was that I was only thinking myself and my own experience, as that was really important to me. In that moment I suddenly realized that everything I do kind of reflects from other people back to me. All my output is someone else's input and then their output becomes my input. This was especially true for my girlfriend as we spend so much time together. This realization felt really meaningful and important. I guess you could say I felt somewhat that we (my girlfriend and I) are deeply connected together. After that I felt really relieved and could really let her see me just the way I am without any act or mask or anything. Just me."
psychedelics,"I was sitting on the couch in my friend's living room. Psy-ambient music was playing. A dose of DMT was measured on a scale and placed in a glass pipe suitable for it. My friend warmed the pipe from below and I took the longest, largest hit of it possible.  The taste was very strong, like burning plastic or metal. Already during the inhalation, my surroundings started to change in color and appearance. I let go of the pipe, and my friend took it. He was ready to offer me another hit, but I indicated that that would not be possible, as the pipe and my friend had already totally transformed in color and shape, and the effects were clearly strong.  I held my breath as long as possible. However, the taste and mouthfeel of the vapor was so strong that I finally started coughing, rising back up to sit. I felt that a gooey, dark substance was being generated in my mouth. I took this gum-like goo into my fingers and kept pulling and pulling it out of my mouth with both hands. It gathered endlessly around my hands like string from a ball. I looked at my hands and around me in total amazement. There had been a shift in colors, I was seeing in a range of colors I never knew possible to even exist. These colors were stronger, more vibrant, more real than anything I had anything seen. I lay down on the sofa and closed my eyes.  In front of my eyes, filling my field of vision I could see a pair of enormous, god-like hands turning around and twisting around each other in impossible, multidimensional ways. They were covered in some sort of hieroglyphic text that was continuously changing and morphing. I could not recognize the characters but somehow I could read and understand the text. The whole vision was shimmering with impossible, vibrant colors. I felt myself existing in more dimensions than ever before, with awareness of spatial extension that I never knew possible. There was a strong sense of foreign presence. I looked (eyes still closed) to my left and could see that some massive creature, statue-like gilded being or god was standing over me, with its entire body similarly covered in shifting, changing hieroglyphic writing. I tried asking it something or communicating with it, and in some sense I felt it understood me and wanted me to come with it.  After a moment, I looked beyond this entity forwards into a larger open space, like a street scene from some cyberpunk future. There was a building, like an industrial hall or underground club, and a group of humanoid entities in front of it. Some were more human, some more insect- or alien-like, many were dressed in leather jackets or long coats. They were surprised and amused to see me. They seemed to be inviting me inside to join them, but I was concerned about what would happen if I went inside - would I, could I ever return to my regular reality.  This was the first point I thought back to where my physical body was, and opened my eyes for a moment. My friend was sitting in lotus position, his edges shimmering in different colors, shining onto me like an ethereal Buddha figure. I realized now that music had been playing the whole time, and much of the visions I had seen had followed the course of the music. I closed my eyes for a while longer and could see a continuing play of colors and dimensions. The view into the future street seemed to dim and then rushed out the window of the room, leaving me opening my eyes and looking out to the dark night. I started speaking and commenting on the experience to my friend in total amazement and awe. I could not believe what I had seen and experienced."
psychedelics,"I was with my friend and our acquaintance at my home. I immediately left my body as always on Dmt, seized to hear anything in the material world and entered the space that was completely filled with one or two entities that were alien to me. Those were very strange, so abstract, that I couldn't find a description for any of their form, and I just remember colors: white and red.  When I entered this realm, it felt like coming home, like I always been there, and it seemed like this omnipresent entity/es was interacting with me for quite awhile, not like we just met. They can even be interacting with us all our lives and we don't hear it. It’s hard to describe how exactly they were interacting with me, cause they didn't use any common language. It reminded me of the ‘alive tunnels’ I saw once during my first journey on DMT, but maybe this time I was inside one. During this I also remember getting into a loop of remembering how I remember myself, sort of fractal remembering, but it wasn't as exhausting as these loops can be. (It’s hard to say if it’s the most important in my life, because I had many. It’s definitely very important in my present life, as in the past I might had different priorities. This experience considerably lowered or removed my fear of death, by entering this realm where I always been, am and will be. It reminded me that body is a temporary vessel, consciousness is eternal.)"
psychedelics,"i don't remember a lot of the very specific details, which have been lost to time. i remember that i had done LSD before and i was taking increasingly larger doses every time i experimented with it. there is a voice in my head, maybe it could be described as my ""ego"", that i found was always there no matter how much LSD (or any drug) i took. i was interested in seeing if there was a point where that inner voice would disappear. i had about ten tabs of LSD remaining and i decided to take them all. it started off as normal_ i was on my computer and putting on some music and the screen started to ebb and flow. the room started breathing. at some point i became frightened and started to worry that i may overdose. i got back on my computer and messaged a friend, who assured me that it was not possible to overdose on LSD and i should just enjoy the ride. i was able to hear that and i wasn't afraid anymore. i vividly remember this feeling, sort of like i was running along a precipice at full speed, on the left of me was land and directly to my right was a sheer drop to a pit of molten lava. and i was just running and running as fast as i could at the very edge. i felt free, like freedom of spirit. i remember at that point saying in my head ""are you still there?"", speaking to my inner voice. and a voice responded, yes, i'm still here. i understood then there was something"" that was me, that made this collection of molecules not the same as any other collection of molecules. but i also remember feeling my connection to all the other molecules in the world. it also helped me see that the way we perceive things as human beings is only one way, and that there are of course probably infinitely more. i remember staring at my wooden floor (or any wood) and watching the grains move, and realizing that there was no reason for me to see that as a solid since technically it wasn't really a solid at all. the experience lasted for somewhere around 8-10 hours. a lot of it was actually really fun, i have flashes of laughing and really enjoying the music i was listening to---it didn't necessarily feel all that ""spiritual"" while i was happening. but after that i was forever changed. the way that i thought about myself and how i fit into the world, the way i understood the science i studied, the way i perceived the human race."
psychedelics,"(my home, I had several days between travels, my friend came to my house for a couple of days to visit me) nothing special until I felt that IT began and I'm sick. I decided not to vomit and after a small tea ceremony, I discovered that the river nearby my house was calling me and I needed to go for a walk. during our walk, all the lights were bright and duplicated each other. all the street was really bright although it was not so dark that night. near the river, I found a nice shore with wonderful tree roots looking above the soil and decided to sit near it. the river was silent. I had a feeling that there is only me and nature. and sometimes my friend is near me. nature was very dynamic. sounds were very clear. it seemed that I can hear everything and nature talking to me. time went slow. mind was very clear. I had some kind of insights (I can't remember them now but at that point, they were important and useful for me). time moved too slow and after a chat with the river and trees inside my had only I felt that my home was calling me. we went home. the way was very long. my short street was endless and I felt that we were going for ages. when we came back, I felt a plateau and a decline in all feelings of The Experience. it was morning already and I decided to have a chat with the mycelium of the psilocybin in the glass and go to bed. I thanked fungi for The Experience with all my heart and felt asleep"
psychedelics,"I did a two day retreat where the experiences were interconnected so I'll give you a description of the two days even though the profound takeaways arrived on the second day.  The setting was ceremonial, out on the dutch countryside and we were approximately 25 people in the group. After some introduction to the ceremony we each introduced ourselves and touched upon our previous experience with psychedelics. Some were beginners and some were veterans. I placed somewhere in the middle. After this, the truffles were administered to one person at the time. You got three options, a small (7g) , medium (10g) or large (15g) dose. I opted for the large dose. We were also told that after a while, we'd be given the chance to take another dose, also then small, medium or large. After receiving the truffles, each person went to the fire in the middle of the ceremony circle and silently told the fire the intention of the trip. Mine was to explore why I'm emotionally “flat”, why I have a hard time discussing feelings and why I'm not more appreciative in my relationship. While waiting for the trip to kick in, the ceremony leader did some chanting (a part I didn't like because it felt silly and forced) while we all waited seated in the circle. After maybe 30 minutes I started to feel some effects. The floor started to move a little and some minor visual distortions appeared. I went to write down some notes in my notebook but one of the leaders advised me to just go with the flow and do the writing the day after. I felt a bit uncomfortable with a “worry” in my body. No answers or insight to the topics I wanted to dive into came to me, it was just the questions that became stronger. Then came the time for the second dose. I hesitated, feeling that “if this is it, I'll prob won't do the second dose because it will most likely only continue like this but worse”. But then my friend who accompanied me on the event had his second dose and I thought “If he can do it, I can too!”. So I had my second high dose. After this, things turned around quite rapidly. Visuals became really intense and beautiful, both open and close eyed and my mood changed to a very positive one. I had a great urge to touch the wooden floor and the pillars. I felt I could push my fingers deep down in the cracks separating the floorboards, almost sinking them into the ground. I also had a deep will to hug someone but we were told to hold off interaction with other participants so I didn't reach out to my friend. Instead I hugged one of the pillars and that felt really good. At this point, the initial questions were not relevant anymore. Instead I just felt love to my family and friends. I tried visualising them but couldn't even see their faces, instead I just saw light and colors but I knew it was them. I lost myself in a tiny piece of fabric of one of the leaders skirt. It was a small universe of its own, like an eternal fractal spiral image. Distances to objects were sometimes stretched out like tunnel. At one time, when lying on the floor, I started to lose sense of my limbs. It was as my body was slowly dissolving. I saw a bright light, like at the end of a tunnel and I wanted to reach out to it. I guess this is as close to total bliss I have ever felt. I did not quite reach it and was taken back to reality but I got a feeling that “someday I'll reach the end of that tunnel and feel total bliss and unity”. The leaders were playing music from time to time and it was truly amazing. The sounds made my body twitch uncontrollably and really amplified the experience. I could even see sounds coming out from the instruments as colourful circles. I just looked at each instrument individually and saw pulsating circles of colors emitted from the center, in tune with the music. It was for sure the most beautiful thing I ever heard. When looking around, I found that there was a pixelated filter applied to the world. Like a honeycomb or spider web pattern. Peoples faces looked almost photoshopped or Matrix like. This filter was also present when I walked outside. When walking to the toilet, the world turned more and more monochrome. This was perhaps natural, as there was less light there, but it felt more like a visual effect than due to low lighting. I could also color small parts of that monochrome world myself, in all the colors of the rainbow. Like painting it with a rainbow brush. When peeing I didn't know when I started and when I was done really. It felt continuous. So I had to feel with my hand to know if it had stopped. Back inside I stopped by my friend asking him about his experience. We re-assured each other that we were both good and enjoyed it. After a while I started to come down a bit. Me, two other participants and one of the leaders sat outside for a while, discussing the experience and what a wonderful place it was. It was a really warm, open and loving conversation. After a while, me and one of the other participants lied down under a big tree at the center of the property. It truly felt like the tree of life and if covered more or less the whole hemisphere. Behind it I could see the stars and they moved rapidly across the sky. I also saw stars falling but this was probably in my imagination. The tree felt like it was made with origami and I could extend the branches further, like I was building it in Minecraft. I repeatedly pulled the grass around me with my hands and I wanted to sink into the ground and be one with it. I had no thought of dirt, bugs etc. and I felt like I could have a worms all over me and I would be perfectly fine with it. The sounds of nature and the surroundings (like a distant train) when going outside were really intense and powerful (in a good way). When coming back in for snacks and come down talk I noticed that the food (nuts, chocolate, dried fruit) tasted amazing and I could feel every bite travelling down my body and out to the cells. It was nice hearing everyone's short recap before going to bed. I was for sure one of the 2-3 people who had the most “floppy” trip to other amusement :) That night I didn't want to sleep inside so I found a hammock. I texted a few loved ones, telling them how much I care about them and appreciate them in my life. I even texted my brother telling him I love him for the first time ever. Before falling asleep I could hear that they were playing and singing along to “You’ll Never Walk Alone” at a nearby barn party. As a Liverpool fan, this felt like a suiting and almost prophetic ending to day 1 and I dreamt very livid and beautiful dreams.  Day two I was a little bit hesitant going into the session since I got the feeling it wouldn’t reach the same height or be able to trump the first night. I decided to lean in though and see where it took me. So I went with the full dose again. This time around I wanted to think about forgiveness, for myself and for people around me who had hurt me through the years. I did not have the same, if any, visuals this time around and I was feeling a bit anxious ut not bad. I just wanted to lay in the hammock, listening to music and seeing the trees move. The guides called me in after while though and said I needed to be in the circle. In there I took a spectator role, seeing two participants who had the experience I had the first day. It was really interesting seeing them go through the same ecstatic feelings of unbelief. I enjoyed listening to the music and talking to my friend. It was a calm, relaxed feeling. Then after a while, I started to think about the guides, how they were constantly helping out, seeing if people were ok, getting water and just generally making the place feel safe and warm. That transitioned to thinking of my mother and how she has been living selflessly for most of her life, helping us kids and so many others. Always giving, always serving and putting us in front of her self. In my adult life, I have always appreciated this but also thought about it as something I took for granted. Now I saw it from a different perspective, that she (and the guides for that sake) give of them self because they get rewarded by doing so. Perhaps not instantly, but sometime and somewhere. Maybe not by the same person but someone else. Because if you do good, you get good. My mother is the one we kids call when we need advice, she is the one my sons want to hang out with. She is the one with many friends who love her and so on. So all the giving has brought her something back. My key takeaway from that was that I truly felt (as opposed to just thought) that what you saw is what you harvest. Do good and good things will come to you. Be generous with your time, love, money or whatever and good things will come - if not today then one day. A bit connected to this was my other takeaway. I recalled a discussion I had with a brief romance of mine say 10 years ago. We discussed that I'm always looking for the something better, feeling that I would have a hard time to settle in a relationship knowing that so many other potentially good looking, funny, cool or whatever partners are out there. Stereotypical “the grass is always greener” thoughts. She said to me then, “No, the grass is greener where you water it”. At that time, I understood that it made sense but I didn't feel it. It didn't stick to me and made me reconsider the patterns in my previous relationships. It was like a Paulo Coelho quote where you think “yeah, it makes sense” but it’s just words. This time, during my trip, when that discussion came up I truly felt it. It was like the penny finally dropped. I wrote to her that same evening, thanking her and saying “It took 10 years, but now I get it”."
psychedelics,"I felt very tactical and wanted to hug and touch people i was with . Not a strangers , but my friends . Some of them we had a conflict for a long term, without seeing each other for years . I felt we had found a good connection and experienced high feelings of love, understanding , compassion. We experiences closeness while dancing, moving, sitting together, massaging each other. I felt happy and released. My ex-husband with whom i felt offended for a long time was tripping with me and we felt safe awith each other for 1st time. I met there a man, we spend amazing day together, dancing and walking around. We started dating after that trip and meeting at this festival. Since few months we still live together. It feels that experience gave us a good start. After that happened i felt renewed, updated. And less tired and depressed. I made important decisions in my life and things started to move on."

psychedelics,"I had 5 g of Cubensis to an empty stomach, accompanied by and at a friend who has been sitting and/or tripping with me before. The trip lasted for the typical three hours during which I was on Shulgin scale 4 trip, completely in bliss and unaware of anything but my trip.  I was experiencing a big tumult in my life: breaking up with a long term partner who was abusive, had a serious crush on a woman living in a different country and a father who felt like he was abandoning a child of four years My trip consisted initially of a lot of crying and accepting my decision in front of my child_ accepting that she would feel disappointed, angry, sad and devastated but later in life understanding my decision Later I saw a lot of beautiful random patterns that merged into white, flowing fractal dragons made of acryl-like plates that had fluorescent sides glowing in iridescent colors and other geometric shapes The most important part for me was when my friend played me the theme from The Curse of the Monkey Island: I met my crush on the trip, dresses as a pirates, offering me her hand and welcoming me to a life of adventure We had a wild pirate-themed adventure in the style of the Pirates of the Caribbean with fireworks, gunpowder, cannons, smoke - and a lot of love I remember vaguely if at all the other parts of the trip itself After that one hour long peak I started to gain my consciousness My friend offered me water, but I couldn't stop giggling whenever he or I said ”vesipullo” or water bottle We went out for a walk in the white night of early June, walking and talking There was an incredibly magical moment when we crossed the bridge between Kulosaari and Mustikkamaa, when a fox lazily jogged past us, almost touching me, as if it sensed that I was in a magical state of mind, still high"
psychedelics,"An American and Australian couple I knew from uni were visiting me in Finland during the summer so I and my two Finnish friends took them out for a sailing trip. During this trip we decided to take some acid we had brought with us on the boat. We took it on this really great island that had several features which made it really conducive towards a fun trip: the nature was incredibly varied and there were lots of creepy deer that followed us around staring dolefully, the island was a former mining facility so there were these very stimulating pools of bubbling slime formed by mining runoff and seaweed, and it was also formerly used as a military facility during the war so there were lots of interesting tunnels and underground areas. Thanks to the good group, excellent weather, and very fun and stimulating island we had a really great time running around, even the one friend who was not on acid (although he got a bit bored during the very long examination of the slime pools). One always feels a bit of anxiety during acid trips but it was much outweighed by the excellent conditions in which the trip took place. Following this we got back on the sailing boat and sailed to a smaller island to sleep, there was an incident as we left where my one friend was wearing his army shirt from the navy and the coastguard came also wearing the same shirts, making him really nervous, but we all thought it was quite funny and made fun of him rather than feeling his anxiety, which I think speaks to the good nature of the trip. Sailing was incredibly refreshing. When we got to the island we messed about a bit then made a sauna, which we called 'happosauna'. The sauna was really psychedelic since my one friend has a bit of an oddly shaped body and sat stooped over the fire blowing on it like some kind of dragon. Similarly the sensory intensity and the atmospheric turbidity of the sauna gave it a psychedelic effect.  What this trip so memorable and important was that I had just 6 months before gone through a deeply traumatic breakup from an incredibly codependent relationship. Even as I am writing now I still love the person in question as I think to know someone so profoundly is to love them on some level for their whole life. At that time I knew taking acid would be risky given my immense emotional fragility, and as night approached I began to feel the complicated emotions creeping up on me, but rather than panic, I went out under the stars and listened to 'pitseleh' by Elliott Smith, in a moment of sublime appreciation for the possibility of happiness still occurring in my life, even in the remaining half of myself. It was a watershed moment in my healing, a sort of 'bonding moment' between myself and my new identity.  I think this moment was only made possible by the very obvious material reality of a good life demonstrated by the trip - that I could stand there under the stars amid breathtaking scenery after a full day of enjoyment with my very fun and intelligent friends. I'm not sure that being sober during that outing would have allowed me to break through the heaviness that was weighing upon me, or put me in a reflective enough state as I went to bed to fully appreciate it."
psychedelics,"I was once again lost yet found. Coming out from a 11 month contract realising that I wasn't stupid nor lazy. All that shame, guilt and anxiety was not mine to carry anymore. It never had been. I needed guidance, rest and to relax. Started with LSD and 2 hours later psilocybin and the MDMA with a refill of MDMA 6-8 hours later. Earlier experiences has shown that the best way to come up on these drugs are doing ""mundane"" tasks as cleaning and washing combined with breathwork and meditation (Dhyana) and physical exercise (yoga). As such I did all this and when the LSD + psilocybin started to hit I was almost done, just a few details more, yet my mind was screaming REST, YOU DESERVE REST!  I made my balcony comfortable with pillows and blankets. I got my speaker and played a playlist I created on Spotify and let it then go into radio-mode.(https://open.spotify.com/playlist/05j0ohzcIdCGD2luNnCZOP?si=36ac816860aa435d (no real name in the account))  I laid down and tried to relax. I felt lonely... untethered and unconnected, I closed my eyes and I was walking in this dark torus. Looking for the light and eventually I saw it before me. I knew I could chase it though I was too tired to do so, been chasing it for answers as long as I can remember.  At this moment the MDMA came into effect. A gust of the wind blew in my face and gratitude towards the wind came about. I am not lonely as I have you wind to keep me company. Then the sun came spreading its warmth and a gratitude towards the sun came about. I am not lonely as I have you sun to guide my way and keep me company. After that each element came and visited. I was crying thanking them for their existence and said I was sorry for forgetting their existence and what they do for me on a daily basis.  Then the dark torus wasn't dark anymore and as I stood still the light in front came around to carry me forward and with it the walls came alive into shapes and forms. All bowed and expressed their gratitude towards me.  Tears running like rivers from my eyes I asked why they were so grateful, I knew what I done. I created you all, tortured you into existence for my own desire. Their response astounded me... Without you we wouldn't exist, you blessed us with existence. Yes, the suffering is real yet you suffer with us as we suffer. You carry it with you all the time as a reminder and for that we are grateful.  I walked the wheel of the torus, conversed with all eyes, watching, bowing. For how long is impossible to say... (time has no foothold in this state of mind.) Later on got up, went into the apartment and gazed upon a backdrop, ""Dear mother tree"" by Pumayana, which I bought with my first salary on the contract. I had never seen it so alive. Each focus point was spinning on its own, in more dimensions I ever known. First I thought it was just from that point where I stood though I walked in and looked at it from different angles and distances and it kept going. I stood for, what felt like, hours until I had to dance.  I started playing more intense music (psytrance) and danced until I couldn't dance. Expressing gratefulness towards my physical body and what it can do. Towards existence itself, Shiva and Shakti, towards Buddha and towards myself for getting this far still not giving up nor conform towards what I do not believe in. Later in the night I was just laying down on the balcony, playing soothing music with lit candles, cuddling my inner child the way I would have cuddled myself if I met myself as I child."
psychedelics,"About five years ago, I had never heard of psychedelic experiences. I was looking for a way to consume cannabis (hashish) other than smoking it. Because at that time I wanted to quit smoking, but I did not want to quit hashish. So I made some attempts, for example, I tried to melt the hashish in my coffee or even suck on a small piece, etc. Nothing was satisfying. So I decided to make a cake and mix in some hashish. I mixed 2 grams of hashish in the batter and made a small cake for me and for my cousin. At first, we both ate a quarter each. Fifteen minutes later, nothing happened. It was frustrating. I ate another quarter, and he refused. Fifteen minutes later, still nothing happened. That was even more frustrating because I felt like we had lost all that hash for nothing. So I ate the last quarter. For the next 30 minutes, nothing happened. So we accepted our failure and started chatting. After less than 30 minutes, I noticed that my cousin was talking and I could not understand a word he was saying. I asked him to repeat what he said, but he could not. I knew something was wrong. We went into the bathroom and looked at our faces. Our pupils were dilated, our eyes were red and watering, and our cheeks were red The experience began  As time went on, the experience became stronger, so strong that it became too overwhelming. We got scared. ''We made a huge mistake,'' I thought to myself. Later, the experience began to hurt physically as well. I had such pain in my knees and legs. It became painful to even stand up. My cousin vomited on the floor. Whenever we lay down and closed our eyes, we would get into this wide, dark space and feel like we were going to fall down. I could hear my cousin moaning. I panicked and thought we were going to die. So I told my cousin that we would help each other not to fall asleep. We should keep each other awake. I started doing physical exercises like sit-ups and push-ups. The pain got worse and worse. It was horrible. I remember saying to myself ''I got us both into this situation and I am going to get us both out of it.'' For at least three hours, we resisted fiercely and panicked more and more. We reached a point where we could barely move as we laid down in the fetal position We agreed that this was it We are going to die I holed up in my room and took the camera with me. It was a real challenge to adjust the camera, but I did it. Each of us laid down on a bed and we began recording our wills and last words. (I still have the video, it's hilarious to watch it now). We turned off the camera, said goodbye to each other and to life, and laid down on our deathbeds.  The next thing I knew, I was just a conscious thing watching this infinite space full of incredibly beautiful colorful shapes and mazes interacting and dancing with each other. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life. I was not aware of my body at all Wow Wow Wow... My cousin_ Oh Oh Oh. Death was beautiful and peaceful  After that, too much happened to remember or even put into words, and words have their limits at this point to describe what happened later on.  I woke up about 3 hours later. I opened my apartment door and looked up at the sky. The sun was about to rise. I was immensely happy to be alive and grateful for everything I was experiencing. I went outside to the meadow, knelt down, and kissed the ground while shedding tears of joy.  Since then, I am definitely a different person with a completely different perspective about who/what I am and what life is. It took me years of self-reflection to process this experience, for which I am forever grateful."
psychedelics,"I was with close friend. We took mushrooms what I had picked up myself. That year I picked 700 liberty caps. Mushrooms was grinded into powder, so average psilocybin content for the species is expected. We had 1g with tea, both of us. My friend was lying down on bed. I was at floor on a mattress. I saw many visuals with my eyes closed and my eyes open. At some point I saw visuals of being in complete different place. I still felt my body but saw different place around me, eyes was closed. Next started the important part. I saw some entity to become me. In this vision, a being was send here on this planet and became me. I felt that it was true. That I had purpose of coming here. Soon I realised that these ""dreams"" what I was seeing was reflection of my mind. I tested this and started to think about my uncle, and soon I saw vision of him sitting on a chair. This was a mindblow for me. I was not sent here from planets of immortals, I was only seeing what I was thinking. And result of my thinking was combination of beauty what I was seeing and Hollywood. Why this was so important? I realised that what is around me, create what I think. So if I surround myself with bad people, bad house etc. it start echo from my own mind. It has been about 12 years since this trip. And still I think about how to surround myself with positive people and positive things. And I believe it works great. Thinking of gods made me hallucinate planet of immortal souls. And souls made me think where my soul came from. And where I came from made me think my purpose. It's all chain like connected inside hallucinating mind. All just a dream and fantasy what feels more real than real life."
psychedelics,"I drank tea made of the mushrooms, and soon after I started to feel nauseated. It however passed quite fast, and after that I noticed the colors being more vibratic. I felt more attuned to my pet cats, and music sounded much more immersive and intense than normally. I also felt more attuned to my own body, and it felt surprisingly good to be piloting it. After that I went to take a shower, and I was astonished by my own reflection in the mirror. I looked like a forest troll, though I was still clearly recognizable as myself. I was still feeling good, but somewhat restless. After the shower, I walked to a nearby and familiar riverside, where it was beautiful summer day. I noticed a large amount of insects and birds I had never seen there before, and overall I was more aware of my surroundings than usual. After that the experience started to fade, but many of the effects seem to last in somewhat diminished form even to today."
psychedelics,"My guide to the Experience is quite fluent when it comes to using. He made sure the ambiance was safe, with lights and music, and by asking me throughout the experience what I wanted to do, how i felt aso. He insisted we had dinner first because in his experience hunger is absent when under the influence. We started at 9 pm. I expected visual acuities but got very few, pixel-like halos from lamps, nothing more. I was curious to see what would happen to my senses and if/how they would connect to my mind and emotions. The only sense that got heightened…or, better say affected, was touch. Little by little i felt no difference in touch between my skin, my friends skin and the air. It was all connected and encompassed in the same mouvement. After a few hours i lost the will to move my body, or touch things, skin, and I just lay still. Deeply embedded in something infinitely spacious. Felt like seconds, days, eons - time was…bent. It's not like when you're drunk and the worlds spins, this was different in terms of consciousness. Being part of a space but still very lonely. I wanted to explore more. We took a walk in the park. I could sense the difference between farmhouse-grass (newly planted, felt plastic) and the old worn out lawn (alive but weary), trees with a ”soul” and ”dumb” trees that had nothing to say. Took a bath but water didn't have the same ’no-boundaries’ feeling like air/wind/skin. Curious thing, in the morning, about 10 hrs post intake, i wanted us to take a morning swim in the ocean. I felt i wasn't at all under the influence but when i jumped my body just sunk. Like it didn't understand i needed to float, heavy body with no instincts to understand the context i was in. Im a really good swimmer so this feeling creeped me out. I had to force myself to surge to the surface, and i swam to shore with the feeling of not being connected to my own body, being only mind. Lasted a few hours. Was lethargic for the rest of the day."
psychedelics,"Intense “insight” as I could clearly see things, ideas racing, connection to nature, some mild hallucinations (talking tree, flashes). Expanded senses, intense smell of flowers. But for many months afterwards, felt positive, happier, optimistic…"
psychedelics,"Testing out a new way of making tea from magic truffles after a pilot retreat for our new business involving psychedelics. Mild onset in a sauna, and afterwards relaxing outside late at night. Set up the music system in the ceremonial space we had used during the retreat and put a mattress on the floor in the middle of the room. Stronger effects started about 1,5h in and then I smoked about 1/4 of a standard strength joint of cannabis. Had the experience that time started flowing backwards, all but the music. Things my friends said seemed to be related to conversations we had earlier in the day and that the night started to go into dawn again. After a little while I was absorbed into the music and had the full on oceanic boundlessness. Lost connection to the current situation and felt it as an eternity in the world of music. All until one of my friends said they needed to go to bed, which started the descent. After several hours lying next to another friend on the same mix of substances, the effects had subsided and I was in awe about what had just occurred."
psychedelics,"I opened notepad on my computer to write down my thoughts, feelings and overall experience and impression on my computer just prior to taking 150 micrograms of 1CP-LSD in the morning of January or February a maybe two years ago. The idea was to get rid of the last of my LSD before starting an SSRI treatment, so I wouldn't get tempted to do psychedelics while on SSRI. I didn't have high expectations due to recent ""low quality"" trips on the same substance, some bordering on difficult and uncomfortable trips. The entirety of the trip took room in my apartment, alone. I am usually under antipsychotic medication and had taken a few days break from them to get the effects from LSD. I almost always write down my trips in a live timestamped format for reflection and nostalgia purposes. Unfortunately at this present moment I don't have the resulting PDF available but if there is a chance to connect via email or later and if it is of interest, I believe I do have a copy of that document still around. It is the most exact and reliably honest version being so close to source experience. I most likely listened to music the entire trip. I typically listen to mellow ambience/drone or psychedelic electronic music. Come up was particularly long and I was beginning to think my LSD was too old/had deteriorated but around the 3 hour mark, I started to notice some significant effects. My mood was greatly heightened and I began to experience a very powerful ""rush"". It felt like I was very energized. I wrote down that it felt like a massive sugar rush. Thoughtwise things was a bit rocky. Thoughts were slippery, hard to hold on to, sometimes confusing. I remember writing down that it was enticing, but also chaotic and fearful. I somehow felt like some kind of ancient master being able to calmly sit through it all. Within a couple of minutes I had to conclude that I did get high on the substance, as the letters on my screen and keyboard were no moving and morphing symbols. From there on, I had several hours of a visual paradise to complement my greatly enhanced mood. The scariness and overwhelming feelings mostly subdued. Thoughts began to settle down. However I found myself much more empathic than usual while all this was going on.  I started thinking about a friend whose mother recently died, and what issues he must go through. I wanted to be there for him as a help but realized I can't do much in this state. I began searching for ideas on how to help, like offering support with cleaning out the old flat. I remember it was a very strange and particular feeling. I felt like I was on the top of the world, ready to help those who had slid down. myself image was mixed. On on part I felt clever, wise and benign. Like some sort of buddhist monk or some quiet godhead. On another part I felt dirty. Social stigma struck me. I had thoughts like ""Do you really think anyone want help from a drug junkie?"" One part of me wanted to offer some LSD to him (he doesn't do drugs), sit down with him and have a very close one on one on life and all. A bonding experience and something beyond the ordinary.  Though the peak of the experience for my private senses to encounter and rejoice with was a rather stunning display of a kind of synesthesia. I had never experienced that before. Somehow, I got my visuals and emotions tangled together. I saw what I felt. If I felt brief fear, sadness, joy, curiosity etc, I saw a very distinct changes in my open eye visuals. I experienced an overlay image of my normal (though morphing) image. It was like if there was a screen between ""me"" and ""the outside"". On this screen, a very beautiful network of lamps, like thin LEDs grew. The detail was incredible, like a high resolution image but without bad eyesight. Depending on my emotions, the colors of the LEDs changed. At first I didn't pay attention to the connection between the LEDs and my mood but as my mood cycled back to a previous mood, I recognized the color and recognized that it changed when my mood changed. And so I began trying to change my mood to look at all the different lights. This caught my attention for quite some time. I remember feeling fascinated and having thoughts something like ""I must have activated some secret neural network that perhaps activate near death to show us that so much is interconnected"". I was in Awe. I was trying to figure out what the mechanism for them to be linked could ever be. Words won't give it justice. Up until that point I had almost dismissed synesthesia as ""probably lies to get attention"". That too, opened up my acceptance for what is possible and was humbling in itself. (Still I can't help but to be on the fence on things like telepathy. I guess I am stubborn in that I need to experience it first hand before I can believe it.)  If memory serves me correct and that I don't mix up a memory from another trip, there was also this open eye ""projection"" on ceiling/wall that looked like a multilayered web of, well, to my impression, neurons. I got the impression that perhaps I experiencing the insides of my brain. While it was perplexing and somewhat interesting to look at, it was easily shadowed by the synesthetic experience. The entire trip was very pleasant overall. I remember wanting to ask police if it would ever be appropriate to hit up girls with some Acid. I remember wanting to ask psychiatrists why they don't give out recipes of Acid for people in trouble too. I felt like ""this is the thing that people turn on to"". It was an incredible experience. I couldn't fathom why anyone would pass this on. (But then again I haven't had the bad trips that other people might have. I am confined to what I have experienced myself and witnessed in others I've met.) Toward the end of the trip, I still had a lot of psychedelic activity going on. I don't remember how long I had been under the influence, maybe 10 hours. I wanted to call it quits and go to bed so I took some of my usual medication (Ergenyl, Risperidon) to end the trip. Which it did within perhaps 30 minutes."
psychedelics,"Complete ego death. I forgot who I was completely. Combined with extremely strong waves of feeling enormously huge waves of pleasure and warmth. I listened to music at points and in the end when I was little more sober took a bath. Afterwards ""afterglow"" with lasted almost 30 hours. Waves of pleasure with small breaks in between."
psychedelics,"The most meaning full experiment with psychedelics was my first experiment. Me and my best friend had decided to try LSD. The decision was a conclusion of what we had read and learned about psychoactive substances in theory. This event took place around 2015. Me and my friend were roommates at that time, and we had decided to do the experiment at home. We had read that the environment should be comfortable and secure. So, home felt like logical solution. We had chosen a Saturday as the weekday to do the experiment since we did not want to be in any rush, and we needed to be out of reach. We woke up early in the morning did a good breakfast and cleaned the house in order the environment to be as comfortable as possible. Afternoon we took the LSD. First 40 to 50 minutes we waited until the LSD started to kick in. First you start to feel these little shakes in your body. Those shakes are almost like you having the chills but not quite the same. Then you start to feel your senses getting more sharpen. It feels like somebody puts the 4K resolution on your eyesight. You can but your endless focus almost in anything you want, and you may observe any sound from the environment. We were comfortably lying in our living room when this happened, and we were communicating these experiences to another. The you start to lose the concept of time. By losing time, I don't mean that you forget to check on what time it is. I mean that the concept of time sort of disappears and becomes meaningless. You are basically so present that time does not exist. And I don't mean any of this in a scary way. I mean it quite opposite. At least for me it was a positive and freeing experience to lose time. Me and my friend had deep and meaningful conversations about our lives. I don't want to into specifics of the conversations, but I believe those conversations would have never happened in under any other circumstances. Those conversations really deepened our friendship and I feel more connected to my friend still these days. We have discussed about this experience afterwards and we both share the feeling. At some point I felt like being inside of the house was little pressing so I suggested my friend that we could go outside. He wasn't comfortable with the idea first, so we decided to leave the idea on the table until he was ready and eventually when the sun started to fall, we went outside. It was a warm summer day and since we live in Finland the early evening was still pretty light. We went to a nearby park, and it was amazing. The nature had not ever felt like that. It was almost like I could communicate with it. We all belonged, and we were all the same meaningless piles of electrons that just had happened to organize in a certain way. It was beautiful. While walking in the park the intensity was obviously cooling down and we felt like we weren't that ecstatic anymore, so we decided to go cycling around the city. While cycling around the city, I was able to see out hometown from angles that I had never noticed before. This was the best sightseeing I've ever done, and the funniest thing is, it was my hometown. After cycling we went home and felt really tired. When we arrived back home, for the first I was curious what time would it be. It was little after 1pm and we decided to go to sleep. While lying there on my bed, I felt like I was glowing. All my harms seemed to be faded away and I was in a total peace with myself and everything around me. After taking LSD the first time, I believe it has given me a tool to observe my life from aspects that sort of weren't there before. It was not just a singular event on a Saturday with a friend. I believe the experience shaped something inside me in a very positive way. I'm not saying that everything that has happened ever since is because of taking LSD but I strongly believe it has helped me in away, that I have managed to change the course of my life into more positive endings. And I feel like a better and more loving human being than before this experience. All the other experiences after this have not felt as meaningful as the first one. But I feel like I still get something out of every experience. Even though it is not the purpose, I don't mind taking LSD being funny as hell."
psychedelics,"the first one was in smarshop in Amsterdam. magic mushrooms, 10g. visual effects, pure happiness, socializing, feeling of unity with everything, first experience of joy for years because of depression the second one was in friends house. 110mkg lsd. a lot of visuals, happiness. she was with me just in case. everything good. a few times 110 mkg lsd. for spiritual experience mostly. feeling of connection, that everything will be alright. was alone in my home, took a walk once, was great Lsd, 220 mkg. badtrip, feeling that it will never pass. mixed with alcohol, so mdma experience — a few times 0.25. loved everything, was kissing friends.  weed — about hundred times maybe. to get inspiration, to do yoga, to have motivation to be alive, just to relax. stopped taking anything because got short-term (10 minutes?) psychosis on crystal meth. kind of afraid of getting that again. clean for a year"
psychedelics,
psychedelics,"I remember, when it started to hit me, I had to lay down a breathe slowly, trying to ground myself, as I did not expect the effect occur with such power.. at least not in a first minutes. Then a friend of mine woke up from a short nap, started to cry saying he was just reborn and that it's the most beautiful thing that ever happened to him. I started to cry too, feeling his emotions. It was very powerful. I was crying for almost three hours from that moment. We were in a beautiful decorated room, lots of crystals and plants. I felt like they're moving and talking to me. Remembering me how beautiful place world actually is. Then for a while I had a moment, that felt a little like a tip of a bad trip. I missed someone really bad and was like ""Omg, so this is it? This is the purpose of life.. I am going to stay like this forever.."" I felt like trapped in a loop where nothing had purpose. Then I realized this moment will soon be gone and that everything is ok. Since then I started to feel connected to everyone and everything, felt strong joy, bliss, thankfulness to be alive. All negative emotions or thoughts I ever felt towards some people, just dissolved. I knew we are all one. I felt all is love, made of love and light. I cried so bad, because I could not handle all the beauty and love and kindness I felt at the moment. I knew everything is just right as it is, that there is no need to intervene. Just to breathe and live. Also the time did not exist. It is hard to explain, but I remember I felt like... time is a box, and the walls of the box just dropped down and I am living freely in a space. It was actually pretty tiring, I was very exhausted after. I consider this absolutely life changing experience. It have no negative impact, just the positive."
psychedelics,"It was end of August in 2011 and the season for the most prominent psilocybin mushroom in the area, Psilocybe semilanceata. I received 30-40 pieces of them from my friend one evening and without really planning to ingest them, I did, later that evening while we were having a hang out and smoking some weed with couple of friends in my home at that time. I remembered listening to music with my headphones while my friends were playing video games next to me. At some point my perception started to shift little by little until I realised that what I felt was the effects from the mushrooms I had eaten. Everything, sounds, visual perception, bodily sensations etc. became somehow more sharp and vivid. I could hear sounds in a way I hadn't before and I could see more clearly than I would usually see. Also some things that I couldn't see normally, waves of light on the wall and maybe some colors and auras on edges of objects, but visually this experience wasn't the most vivid I've had. I felt euphoric, happy, loving, energized and still peaceful at the same time. It was a novel feeling, but still it felt kind of familiar. Like coming home. But to a new home. Maybe the most striking thing in this experience is that how it shifted my focus and sparked some hidden passion for life inside of me. Even very little thing was so interesting. Like I was a baby again in a way. Things I usually got excited about were secondary (I utterly loved to smoke cigarettes that evening though, which sounds odd when remembering it..). I could look a tree or a street light or breath and feel the cool autumn air with such a passion and focus that it's striking in this day still. How good it felt simply to be alive. Pure understanding and acceptance, still without really understanding or accepting anything. Merely a glimpse of potential of those things So. I was so energized that I couldn't resist to take a walk outside. I told my friends that I would go and they let me, still wondering why, but still. I started walking. In this new world I had suddenly found. Just purely perceiving things what became in front of me. Breathing, walking, breathing, walking. Looking things in awe. Just utterly enjoying it. How could just walking be this interesting? There was this vigour and energy in my step. Like I had tapped to a nuclear power plant. I just went on and on, never really doubting that I would be lost. I knew all the time were I was and felt safe.  I ended up taking a long walk through my hometown and became back home at some point of the night. My friends were drowsy and beginning to sleep. I tried to sleep also, but were still so lifted from the experience that I really couldn't and woke up repeatedly. I recall I managed to get some sleep in some point and woke up in the morning feeling good."
psychedelics,"Me and 3 of my closest friends went to my family cottage near the woods. We woke up in 3 AM, took LDS, started a fire and waited. After 40 minutes we all started to feel something. Typical ""LSD high"". I started to feel incredible fear, because I was scared, that my parents will find out about this (but there was no way they could find out about it). After next 20 minutes the fear was gone, and I started to lose sense of myself, I started dissolving into ground, into bench and started very slowly falling to my friend next to me. After next 10-20 minutes (I'm not sure) I was not able to tell who am I, not where am I, who am I, what I like or who are people around me. After some time i remembered name of my friends, later that I like music, that I like to make music and more and more and more. My name came to me after 20 min or so. In next 30 minutes I started to feel better, sun was rising and about and hour I was completely me again. Rest of the day was usual LSD trip. Visuals, ecstasy and other typical aspects were as usual, that means exaturated color contrast, geometry ornaments, exaturated symmetry of things, closed eyes visuals."
psychedelics,"I was at home (I live with my parents) and ate 1,2 g dried Psilocybe Serbica, my highest dose yet. As the peak came I smoked some weed. I was planning to experience the trip at home, listen to music and meditate. I wasn't feeling the best so I thought I could change the setting and go for a short walk. As I walked through the village, I was looking around me and was somewhat fascinated about things. I was looking at things and thinking about them in a different way. I was somewhat nervous, because I sometimes experience small to moderate social anxiety. As I got from the village to the nature, I felt at such a peace, calm and fascinated. I was observing all the parts of the nature. I was thinking about my life and was so happy with how my life is and accepted everything. Everything is as it should be, I thought. I felt like the time wasn't existing. It was kinda weird, but really good feeling and I was experiencing just the present moment. I was walking through a path that was jungle-like and had a lot of obstacles. I was thinking that lot of people wouldn't choose that path or would have a lot of negative thoughts about it and were looking forward to the end. But I didn't have any negative thoughts, accepted my situation, wasn't rushing anywhere and was just enjoying the present moment. Then my planned short walk (circa 30 minutes) got somehow longer (2 or 3 hours), because I was enjoying walking and observing the nature and thinking about life. I was just happy and satisfied with how my life is. Then I got home still somewhat high and talked a bit to my parents without any anxiety, which I thought I would have at least a bit while talking to them."
psychedelics,"It was during a train + boat trip for a day with a friend. We took LSD at the beginning of the day, and we smoked a few joints during the day. I was doing well. I was enjoying the beautiful landscapes and we were creating music on a computer. During the last part of the trip (the last train to get home), we took Ketamine. I started feeling to high and started bad tripping. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable in my body. I couldn't move. And I thought about how bad my life was. I could think very fast and link some thoughts I had never linked before. It was harsh, but I realised the 3 key problems in my life and then went to a psychiatrist to start psychotherapy. It was a bad moment but necessary to move on and start therapy."
psychedelics,"I went to a center in Peru, in Amazonia, shipibo village. I went there with a friend who had first the desire to take ayahuasca, close friend recommended this place. We stayed for 1 week. Sunday: purge Monday night: 1st ceremony Wednesday night : 2nd ceremony Friday night 3d Ceremony In Between, dieta (just eat what ur body needs to keep alive, rest/meditate/sleep/process/smoke/laugh/sing/...) The 2nd ceremony from 8pm to 4pm I drank the glass and go on my mattress to smoke the pipe. We are around 10 people, including 3 shaman brothers for guidance. They open the ceremony and sing Icaros during it. They re here if u need anything and come close by each person for a whiée during ceremony All quiet and beautiful. The moon, the animals, the earth and the Cosmos. i can access to a bigger picture, where I do belong and where we all are. it s light , so much ! Love, so intense. i am, there, a dragonfly. The transformation/mutation is also real in the sanctuary. my arm mutates , and I ask the spirit of ayahuasca, who came to me to bring me there that i can really travel, to let me come back because it is already too much. I vomit the potion and then am just in light, touched by Faith for hours. And I cry about me being alive and how much everything is so beautiful and sweet to me now. I thank the Moon, and I now experience love everyday. I am the light and I am reborn during this experience. I think about it everyday, and it all makes sense then."
psychedelics,"Here is what I experienced (the word is weak, and all the words that will follow are too weak) when I took Bufo for the first time (July 6, 2018) - It all started by a materialization of my consciousness. When my lungs are full of what the toad has given me (gratitude), my consciousness wells up within me as a palpable thing, a sort of liquid whirlwind. First in my head, then in the space of my whole body, my consciousness becomes all my body and my head and my spirit, and my breath, there is no more difference between “me” and “my consciousness” which became material (or I became consciousness). This is just the moment before the expansion. I see this materialization as the condition of what will follow: I must grasp my hyper-locality, the exact limit of my usual self, as gathered here and now, hyper-singular, in order to then be able to let go of it. It's like gathering the pack so it can rush. And then, 2 second after the beginning, it is the expansion. This material, fragile but condensed is defocusing. It extends faster and faster and in all directions. It spins like the walls of a bubble of soap that never stops swelling, a film, a veil, that contains me. Yet, in the space of a last moment, the only one moment, appears the feeling that I will reach the edge of the universe, this uncertain “I” which is distributed in this membrane. Then there is no real memory. I arrived at the border, I know it from what I perceived just before, because at the border I do not be more. Expansion involves dilution. I am tall, but, immense, I am no longer singular and I am no longer “me”, no longer this little me that I carried around the world and linear time so far, the only one I known. Diluted, I'm not and I'm everything. Obviously I can't remember what was next, that would be contradictory. No feeling of death, not in the dramatic and terrifying sense: it is about ceasing to exist the only way I knew I existed so far. It is to exist otherwise. It is without doubt what death is. A definitive lesson for me is that there is no problem with death_ you have to enjoy living and you have to embrace death when you are there (this teaching is facilitated by my feelings of previous experiences of connection with the World, under MDMA). When I come back, I half-open my eyes and “become aware of my surroundings”, i.e. this immense and tenuous consciousness incited by the Bufo is now mixed with my usual self-consciousness. And there I feel like a glove turned-in and out, which causes nausea that I accept because it is the fruit of this divine experience - how to be upset? Turned upside-down because by coming back I brought back the whole universe inside me, as if this membrane of consciousness thrown at the edge of the universe was the net of a fisherman that I now have just brought “on board” with all the caught treasures . But yet I also see the whole universe in this room: everything is vibrating, the beings are half ""as usual"", made of flesh and immediate presence, and half, literally half of their bodies, stretched out in a luminous trail, a wake of sparks in the luminously soft substance of the World. Everything is in me and everything is outside of me. I spend the next few moments going back and forth between inside and outside, between infinity and here. Sometimes it's unbearably beautiful. I look at Saranda and after a few moments the vision of her beauty becomes unbearable, I have to go back there in the distance. The teaching, the lived feeling that has not left me since, is that I am whole, unique and One. month"". The corollary of having brought back the whole universe in me is that I brought back “all my selves”. End of the dichotomy. I no longer perceive “my mind” as a force opposed to “my inner self”, or “my deeper self”, or my “higher consciousness”. When I go to meditate for the next few weeks, the activity of the mind flows on the same level as the presence of all these other consciousnesses of me, I do not see separation. And so another lesson - always the same, behind each of my experiences in fact - is that there is no problem. But that, I still have trouble living it on a daily basis"
psychedelics,"My psilocybin experience occurred on a gorgeous Summer day with my spouse and our friend of 20 years. The setting was gorgeous, safe and comfortable.  I spent the first 3 hours of the session in child's pose, very internal, with a playlist including world music.  In those 3 hours, I lived hundreds of lives, or had the experience of slipping from one consciousness to another with total ease, one after another after another. I was a Japanese baby one moment, a man on a deck in Santa Cruz the next, a crusader the next, all genders, all times, all cultures one after another. I realized I was working up a sort of spiral staircase of consciousnesses, and when I reached the top, a being was there. She was represented as the the Virgin Mary clad in aqua with a golden crown. She was crying. She said, ""I see the suffering, I love you endlessly, but there is nothing I can do about it. You [humanity] must help me, you are all my treasures, you must do the work of loving, you must act for me."" I knew that she was the ""lady of infinite vision and infinite compassion."""
psychedelics,"This was written ten days after the event and posted on a website dedicated to 5-MeO-DMT. Backstory I am a middle aged woman with several kids and a successful career, history of addiction in teenage years, some depression and anxiety since, mostly resolved now. I have been seeking non-dual awakening most of my adult life, beginning with Vipassana training in my twenties and continuing with an on and off meditation practice since, several retreats, and voracious reading of any non-dual philosophy I can get my hands on. I believe in the scientific method yet I can not accept materialism as a logical explanation for What Is. It makes no empirical sense to begin one's search for truth with an abstraction (matter) and try to derive from that abstraction the one and only fundamental experiential reality we have direct knowledge of (consciousness). I have been using psychedelics as a tool for understanding reality for several years. I have had a number of insights in this way but they generally fade quickly with time and becomes less distinct. Until now. I have read every book and article I can find on 5-MeO-DMT in the past 3 years and have been seeking this molecule like the Holy Grail in that time. It has taken 3 years to come to me. This was the correct time frame. It never was up to me. I have read many awakening experiences and had never had one of my own, not really. My deepest, most secret and shameful fear has always been that I was deluding myself, and that perhaps there is actually no Truth that can be known, or that I am for some reason not worthy or capable of knowing it. My terror was that I might die without ever having been absolutely sure of anything. Preamble The experience was at a group retreat facilitated by knowledgeable, experienced guides. We started earlier in the morning with a ""toe-dip"" via vape pen outdoors, in which my experience was one of gently being drawn along a path of the loss of objects and concepts. The visuals were very gentle, pastel fractals which did not demand any interaction from me. The physical sensation was one of merging into the land and sky_ sounds were omnidirectional, light was brilliant through my closed eyelids, and the emotional sensation was reassuring and peaceful, quite the opposite of my experiences with N,N-DMT. I remarked that instead of feeling like a lot of visual, emotional and conceptual content was being added to my perceptual field as with N,N, this was the sensation of content being removed, falling away. I felt there was a path along which I could pass, where less and less would clutter my inner awareness, and that I could see this would lead ultimately to a single point. ""I just want to get to the point!"" I suddenly quipped, realizing the exquisite pun. I thereafter took another dip with the vape pen and lay face down on the grass, feeling the wind and sun and dirt and reveling in this very animal experience of being a biological being on this beautiful planet. At no time was there any fear or any ego loss. Very gentle. The event The main event happened that evening with synthetic 5-MeO-DMT via glass vapor genie in three doses: 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg. This was served in a safe indoor setting with two guides and two beloveds accompanying me. Doses were determined by my guides without any input from me. The 3 mg dose I don't remember anything about. The arc of the 6 mg dose and the 12 mg dose was essentially the same, the symphony described below. After the 6 mg dose I said ""don't let me forget this, I won't forget this will I?"" It was so incredibly clear, and then it started to scatter and I feared I might forget it so immediately went for the 12 mg dose which delivered the same experience with infinitely more clarity. In order for the lesson to be received as I received it, it was psychologically necessary to see it as having been orchestrated and delivered by ""someone"" and my ego, once back online, attributed this skill to my guide. I have since realized that of course she did not orchestrate my inner experience, but to absorb it with the impact I did, that step was necessary. The belief that ""she did it"" was a bridge to a fuller understanding of what was learned. The symphony in movements The deconstruction As the smoke leaves my lungs and gentle fractals whirl extremely rapidly, awareness focuses into a tunnel heading towards a point. ""I've been training for this my whole life"" is my last thought in words. Every life experience is instantly seen as relevant then discarded, peeled away, released, its gem of meaning consolidated into the elegant, unified path of understanding unfolding within. All identities released. All self inquiry absorbed. All non-dual intellectual understandings metabolized. All meditation experiences understood. All psychedelic lessons integrated. The pinnacle Everything falls away. The sum total of my life's quest is balanced on a tiny, silent pinnacle and there is no further path ahead. A feeling of uncertainty, apprehension, nowhere to turn, what now? A pause. The void The pinnacle vanishes. The gem of the sum total of my life's quest silently goes ""poof"". There is NOTHING. There is NOTHING. There is NOTHING. The sensation is abject. Utterly lost. No one to orient and no experience to orient to. Drifting, writhing, with utter helplessness in the void. There is no coming back from here. It was nothing all along. This is not a metaphor. This is the absolute reality. There is no one to have an emotion but if there were it would be one of existential horror and futility and ultimate aloneness. The gathering of energy From the writhing, helpless drifting, energy begins to swirl and grow and gather, colors of deep blue and purple, like liquid metal, swirling in a cosmic whirlpool, pressure growing, all the energies of the void collapsing together with incredible velocity and infinite force. There is something again_ that which would orient tries to find the orientation to the rising energy as it grows to infinite intensity and focuses into a single point. The singularity / the realization / the ultimate irreversible surrender The energy collapses into a singularity containing all of space and time and awareness, absolute pure reality as it is, utter certainty, the I Am. Surprise, shock, realization, ecstasy as the single pure shining high note of reality as it is shatters the person, destroys it with joy and no turning back. This is all that matters. This is all that is. Transcendent understanding. Absolute certainty. All that once seemed important is moot here at the end of the story. Everywhere and nowhere. The understanding is embraced with urgency and abandon. The obviousness is overwhelming. At the core of reality there is ultimate certainty. This is worth every sacrifice and surrender is total. The supernova of reality as it is The singularity gives birth to Reality As It Is in a supernova like a cosmic orgasm. Reality as it is without orientation. All prior concepts are seen as pure illusion, laughable, HILARIOUS. The idea that a person's ideas about reality have any relevance to anything at all is FUCKING HILARIOUS. The idea that there is something to be attained is FUCKING HILARIOUS. I get it!! The full force of the joke hits me. The mastery of the set up, destruction and revelation hits me. My guide is holding my hand smiling a smile that confirms for me at the deepest level what I already know, which is this truth can never be unseen, nothing has ever mattered, this is the cosmic joke, and it was masterful. Not a step was missed, not a motion wasted in the execution of this lesson. The impact has destroyed me and I am so grateful and I say to her fiercely ""That was PERFECT. You are a MASTER. You are a FUCKING ARTIST."" The fall and the impossibility of anything mattering Identity returns and it is meaningless. It is HILARIOUS. The idea that the only true thing in existence, once seen, could be forgotten, is HILARIOUS. Everything is hilarious! I laugh and laugh and laugh. Every idea that occurs to me is hilarious. The idea that anything could ever have mattered is hilarious! I laugh and writhe and kick my feet. I feel totally naked now, all lies and self deception are destroyed, because who would lie to whom? How would we ever fake anything? Nothing matters. I am reborn into truth. I am liberated. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you"" I say. Ideas and concepts are drifting tatters around me and I understand why people act so unpredictable and crazy after they smoke 5. It is impossible to self-censor, there is no one to censor, it can't be done. The ""I"" that emerges is not the one who went in. Nothing will ever be the same, this is clear. I laugh and laugh and laugh for half an hour at least, my beloveds looking on with love and questions and a bit of apprehension in their eyes. I can't tell them. This can't be told. Only my guide knows. ""You are a fucking artist"" I tell her again, needing to express this in some way. ""I've never had a psychedelic experience like that. That's what I have been looking for. Thank you. Thank you. I'm done. I never need to have another experience in my life. That was it."" The aftereffects The effect of this destruction has been overwhelming. I was deeply blessed to have an amazing community of chosen family with me on this retreat, who held me as I laughed and cried and was unable to cook or eat or hold a conversation. There are layers upon layers of understandings unfolding. There has been joy and fear and ongoing reactivations, nearly continuously for the first 48 hours after the ceremony, still continuing now 10 days out. This will take some time to integrate. Memory of the event continues to reveal itself and clarity increases each day, unlike every other psychedelic experience I have ever had. It seems as if every lesson I have ever learned from psychedelics has simultaneously been proven true and yet my original understanding was seen to be completely trivial. All the things I thought I knew, I didn't really know. One thing I thought I knew is that psychedelics make you honest. This is true, and yet the way I lived this before was superficial, it seems. Previously I had a strong drive to be honest and authentic, but it was still seen as a choice. Two days after this experience I awoke feeling the void, and though I could see everything and use language, I felt I was no longer a person. It seemed clear that the boundaries of the person, the things that make me ""me"" and not ""not-me"" are all at their essence lies. I am trying to understand the implications of this for my daily life. Another thing which was driven home in its ultimate form was the fact that I am responsible for apprehending Truth, myself, without mediation. No guru can come along and define Truth for me. I can not abdicate this responsibility. As a manifestation of the One, it is up to me alone to learn, integrate and trust the Truth that unfolds for me. This also led me to finally realize the thing I had only ever dared to hope before, which is that YES, I can trust reality. I can trust the Universe. The core of reality is trustworthy by definition. The seeing of Reality As It Is without orientation confirmed something for me with deep clarity that I had understood and yet not understood. It is clear that Reality IS, and this is primary. Previously I interpreted this as something along the lines of ""everything is perfect and unfolding as it should, so don't worry"" or ""life is more fulfilling and joyful when I don't identify with or even create judgements about what IS"" but what I saw in the singularity is that these interpretations are entirely beside the point. Reality IS. Full stop. What I think about it, whether I find a way to be happy with some understanding that it's all ultimately perfect or not, is completely fucking irrelevant. Reality IS. I Am That. Does someone here know a way to put this into the English language in a way that conveys the IMMENSITY of this revelation? This is one of the key insights and I'm having a hard time explaining in words why this is so ultimately true and important, even to others at my retreat. The importance of a safe, loving, trusting container in which to do this work was revealed as essential. I have done lots of psychedelics in my bedroom with my partner, yet I can't imagine doing this work alone, without an experienced guide at minimum. I had total safety with many people to hold me for days, and this I believe was one of the keys to allowing this experience to unfold for me the way it did and needed to. I feel I could have really messed myself up had I acquired this substance on my own and gone for it with the hubris of considering myself an experienced meditator and psychonaut. I am so thankful that did not happen. Though I said ""I never need to have another experience again in my life"" I should clarify that of course I know that I will have experiences, and that I want to. If it is possible for me, I will continue working with 5 as long as it will allow me to. But I don't NEED to. The fundamental questions that kept me in fear of death (is there a Reality and can I trust it?) have been answered. I consider myself the most humble and beginning initiate now, but finally I see I am actually on the path I have sought. And if this is the extent of the revelations I get in this incarnation, it is enough. I am eternally grateful. I have long believed that the quote below is true. I hoped. I trusted... Now I know. Knowing is different. ""You live in illusion and the appearance of things. There is a reality. You are that reality. When you understand this, you see that you are nothing, and being nothing, you are everything. That is all."" - Kalu Rinpoche"
psychedelics,"5MeO experience one week ago - initial burst of strong energy that dissolved the Default Mode Network. I was not afraid but quite surprised! The initial burst resulted in wave after wave of tension and release creating profound relaxation in my body. I had been working with ending a 15 year long trauma loop and trauma bond with an ex-husband. These successive waves of tension-and-release dissolved the trauma loop and I was freed. After that, I continued to surrender myself to the waves of relaxation that continued, less strong but palpable, for the next 20 minutes. Such bright white light that felt like God but not quite. On reflection, I think it's a brilliant, kind and loving sentience that is transdimensional and the medicine itself is a transdimensional vehicle. It may even be myself at a much higher dimension. It was a powerful first-person realization, akin to an enlightenment experience: self-evident. But it's already a memory but the effects of the medicine have reduced my anxiety by 80%, have reduced my looping worries by 90%. This past week I have slept so soundly as I haven't done in decades. I feel more rested than ever before and this is enormously restorative. The experience has more deeply bonded myself and my husband and the commitment to our relationship."
psychedelics,I made the realization that I need to be more aware of my actions towards others. My intention might not always be what it seems at face-value. Sometimes my desire to care for others causes me to misinterpret the signals people send.  This came to me as I was fully aware of my friend and how the trip affected him badly. I started to care for him and tried to make things better for him. This didn't go so well as he didn't have a bad experience at all. Nothing bad came of it and our respective inner journey and experience could continue. But it made me realize that I needed to do some more work with myself and from where my actions and behavior towards other stems from.  (I am a licensed clinical psychologist and work with children and adolescents. So this is not completely new as this is something we've been taught and read about in length. But I hadn’t experience it in such a impactful way. It also made me rethink and actually left the therapeutic work and became a manager instead.)
psychedelics,"First my body relaxed thoroughly, and then I could see only a fluctuating colourful blur. It was the first time I completely lost my vision during a trip and soon it got pretty scary. I felt like everything ceased to exist and may not return to existence. I waited in bed for my vision to come back, which it very slowly did, but I was afraid that I and everything else might not exist ever again.  I managed to make enough sense of the physical world to call a friend, because I needed a confirmation that I, the people in my life, and everything else still existed. Hearing a friend's voice was the sweetest thing I have ever experienced. He told me everything is ok and the effect will pass. We hung up after a moment, and I cried harder than I have ever before. My face was absolutely soaked, but I didn't cry of fear, but of gratitude. I was so utterly grateful that our beautiful planet and everything it carries has the privilege to exist. The fear tried to come back again, but I called another friend and we talked for over an hour. I needed constant confirmation that the world and people still exist, but I got that from talking/listening to my friend. Slowly but surely the effect diminished, and I was in a more familiar trip state, where I could consider myself, my life, and everything from a broader view with great ease. I started using the state to ask questions about my life's challenges, e.g. why do I feel like I'm not a real human and don't deserve to be here, but I know everyone else is and does. It was clear to me that the feeling came from how I was treated by my family in my childhood. It was also clear that there was absolutely no sense in feeling like that. My family ruled over me in the past and made me feel that way, but now, many years later, they have no power over me. In fact, when I considered realistically how the people in my life today treat me, I noticed that I am greatly appreciated as a friend and a colleague. It always felt wrong to receive praise and kind words, because I had learned as a child that I am sub-human and inherently defective and insufficient. So, after the experience I've felt immensely grateful for existence, as opposed to non-existence, the amazing planet Earth (and the whole cosmos) and all the beautiful things and creatures it sustains, my tiny and messy little apartment and perhaps most of all other human beings, who are just so magical and wonderful. Consciousness and living creatures are just... wow."
psychedelics,I was out with friends and my girlfriend and we decided to take some e. We took them in the club and went on to a studio to party. When we was inside the studio they kicked in. We all was listening to music and talked a lot. Maybe an hour in to the experience my friend was talking and when I looked at him a third I appeared in is forehead. I was not scared but more shocked and didn't say anything to anyone so that no one would get scared. After a couple of minutes another friends girlfriend asked another friend if the es was spiked with LSD. No one knew and then she continued with saying that she thought he were because she saw an eye in the forehead of the same friend that I saw having a third eye. I was shocked and told everybody I saw the same thing. Everybody was a bit shocked but we continued partying all night and had a good night. My friend ( with the third eye) had a loss of his child a couple of years earlier and I thought that maybe he had reached a higher mindset after that and the eye appeared when we all was more open to it I don't know.
psychedelics,"This took place many years ago at a friend's place where we were by just the two of us. It was my first experience with a psychedelic substance. I was not sure if it would work and what to expect. But we had arranged things so that we had a lot of peace and quiet. After I had taken the dose, we were watching television, and the first thing that was out of normal was that when the news ended and the weather broadcast started, the meteorologist Juha Föhr seemed so funny that I and then my friend too burst out laughing. I felt completely normal and sober though, so I did not immediately connect this with the psychedelic substance. Then my friend asked if I could see anything funny in the white ceiling, and while I thought that of course not, I lied down, looked at the ceiling, and indeed I could see all kinds of interesting patterns there. From now on I knew I was tripping, and that it was quite different from what one could have expected. I felt completely clear and lucid in the head, like I was thinking a lot more clearly than normally. The visual effects were not very strong, but it was more a conceptual thing about understanding that the world was much richer and more complex than one could superficially think. I thought that the much quoted William Blake lines ""when the doors of perception are cleansed, everything will appear as it is, Infinite"" were spot on: the infinite was present in everything, and you could delve into more interesting details in everything, as if everything was fractals. This also meant somehow that you could see beauty in everything. I had read a bit about Buddhism, and thought that it seemed to make perfect sense to adapt oneself and ones desires to this infinite and beautiful life. During the next year or so, I took the psychedelic substance a few more times in different settings. I feel that from that first time on, it profoundly changed or even defined me as a person. It somehow convinced me that the World is more to what the eye can see, and more beautiful and valuable."
psychedelics,"I had very difficult headaches those days, and treatments didn't seem to help with it, the neurologist I was felt like he had given up with me, so when I learned that psychedelics have helped some people with their conditions, I felt I need to give it a try. I wanted to be able to freely explore and express everything (I had enough confidence that I trusted my mind can not harm me, although some experiences can be extremely difficult) and I also felt that I would start to worry if the sitter can handle it, so I chose to be alone. I had some previous experiences and I knew it could get scary, but I also knew that I had some very good friends I could call if something went wrong. However, I prepared my home possible difficulties in my mind, created very comfortable and safe playlist, selected some poems and photos that comfort me etc., so that I could distract myself from difficult loops.  My memories are fragmented, the trip went around some themes. Very dominant one was my fear, I was afraid I couldn't trust myself under LSD and that I would accidentally harm myself, there were moments when I was afraid that my body would just stop breathing, my attempts to be sure, my desire to be alive and then trusting the body, relaxing the grasping. I didn't feel hunger or thirst very well, and similar pattern emerged here. I have history with fainting, and I was worried I would faint if I wouldn't remember to eat or drink. And the problem was I had no idea if I needed to eat or drink, so I very kindly (I had prepared some fruits and snacks beforehand) served myself some food and drink and then tried to listen if my body wanted it or no. I remember taking water into my mouth and then feeling that my body really doesn't want the water and I didn't want to force it at all. I lost my sense of time completely - I didn't know if I tried to drink a minute or five hours ago, and I didn't remember what the time was when I last time checked, so I decided to use my alarm clock and I set it to ring, let's say that after three hours or something. So this gave me some freedom from this eating and drinking worry and I really appreciated the time limit, I realized how I could relax and feel safe when I could trust I had a boundary, a timeline, when I was going to do something.  I think I took a shower but don't remember it well, maybe pleasure, the water.  It was touching and cute how much I had tried to make sure that I would feel safe. The playlist, oh, I didn't want it, I didn't want the music I knew, that was safe, I knew I wanted something new so I freely explored the Spotify. And windows and mirrors, during my first LSD trip they scared me, so I covered the window with the curtain before the trip, but then, during the trip I just felt it was a prison, and the images that my mind created to the windows were, yes, scary, but I turned towards them and wondered if this is really the most scary thing my mind can make up. Is this what I was afraid of? I felt silly and it was touching too, I saw my efforts to keep me safe and how it also hurted and limited me.  The watercolors were ready for me, I had thought I might would like to explore and enjoy the colors, maybe to create something, but during the trip I saw I wished to be productive, to ""get something"", and I felt so sorry for myself. I realized how little I allow myself to enjoy. And when the alarming clock rang I went to see if I wanted to eat or drink and wrote down when I had eaten and set it to ring again. But the pleasure, I really didn't want to be productive, I saw how much pressure I had, how much I forced myself to be productive, to be ""a decent"" and proper person, how much guilt I if wasn't. I felt I wanted to enjoy, the yearning, the need. I saw how often I ignored what I needed, the contrast was huge since now I really tried to listen what this being needed, wanted, and it felt very healing. I also felt how much I wanted to be held, how much I wanted a relationship, to have someone to share life with, and the longing felt very precious, no need to get rid of it. So the question was what I really needed and wanted and what would be healing. And the answer was pleasure. I felt joy and appreciated the pleasure, didn't judge my need or want. I remember the playful feeling, curiosity, while I walked to bed. Sheets felt good, I warmed the glass dildo in water to make it as pleasant as possible, undressed myself. And then, for quite many hours, maybe five, six, I enjoyed the touch, I allowed my body to relax and to turn on. Sometimes it was erotic, sometimes I just held myself or wondered. The painting on the wall amazed me, I think I spent some time with it. The experience of coherent body disappeared and appeared, sometimes I was confused but felt safe, enjoyed the exploring. The sexual experience was very pleasant, allowed myself all the pleasure I could take. Laying on the bed, I felt and saw how I was a child, a young woman, an old lady, a frailty elder at the same time, I had many selves and appreciated them all.  (This was not a world changing experience but showed me what was going on my life and mind - LSD worked as a mirror, I believe psychedelic drugs don't show us ""the truth"" but our own mind, we see what we are. And what I really appreciated, was that the pain disappeared and for some months I microdosed LSD to survive with the pain. I was relieved that the microdose worked as well (maybe 20ug) because I had no interest on full trip for 12 months or something after this)"
psychedelics,"(I was with my friend who currently had a problem with his girlfriend. So we went out to a pub and after few beers we decided to took 1cp-LSD. It was a way for him (and for me) to open up.) We spent the whole trip in the center of the city we both live in. We were walking through an arcade and he suddenly broke down, he started crying, he was afraid his girlfriend was gonna leave him. I stood there for a second and I thought that he and his emotions were so disgusting. But in the end I found the empathy and hugged him. He needed comfort and I was able to provide it. But it was hard for me, because I already lost the connection he was afraid he would lose.  We were walking past some hotel and in the hall behind glass there were sitting three people. We found it so hard not to stare at them because we found them so absurd. It was like three o'clock at night.  We stopped in front of the National Bank and we started reading some law text they had there on an interactive screen. It sounded so absurd. And eventually we started saying to each other every time we witnessed something absurd ""How to human"". We were walking through the city the whole time and we were talking about our lives and about our feelings. We discussed how we feel like junkies and how this is an unhealthy coping mechanism. Even though it is extremely rare and helpful. We walked to a park next to our former high school, where we (me, him, his girlfriend) were classmates. We sat there on a bench. He started playing the guitar and my insides (intestine) started moving to the music. It felt funny. At one point I could not remember my live beside those moments I was tripping. I was scared but I started to think about where I am and with a bit of strength I started remembering my time at high school. We sat there for a quite a long time. He played the guitar and I watched how the whole world moved to the beat of the music. I felt calm and I think he did too. As the time progressed it started to feel as we spent our whole lives on the bench. It was quite hard to get up and go home. We had to go to university to attend lectures. But eventually we managed. We got up and slowly started going to bus station.  At the bus station his bus arrived at first and he left. I went to my station that was across a small park. The park looked dark and dreamlike as it was foggy. I was scared to walk through, I was afraid I would get lost. But I went through and arrived in time. The bus arrived and since I did not touch the button that would open the doors (i did it telepathically) the bus left. I got scared and sad and I started walking towards the next stop, which was only about 100 meters away. And there I got on the bus. The trip slowly ended on the bus. I arrived at home, had a breakfast and went to school, but in the middle of the lecture, the professor started to melt. But I closed my eyes and it stopped."
psychedelics,"I had a very stable childhood in an average income home. I suffered no major traumatic events during childhood. I was a top performer in school, matriculating with 8 distinctions. I was privileged enough to get a bursary to study chemical engineering. At age 21, I suffered my first depressive episode, and since then, I have been battling the suffering almost continuously. At one stage, I was so depressed that I even tried committing suicide, but luckily, it failed. At 26, I was blessed with a beautiful son. Although this gave me a sense of meaning in life, the depression pursued.  Late 2022, my fiancè (and mother of my child) and I separated. I experienced this as a major failure. Not per se the breakup itself, but the fact that I always were the star child in the family, and now I don't only have an extramarital child, like most of the other family, but also raising a child in separate houses. After reading about some benefits of psychedelics, I decided to try it on New Year's Eve. My 'trip' started off relatively badly. It was as if I saw this whole failure of raising a child in a broken environment vividly, almost from ""outside."" But this was quickly replaced with a warm feeling of gratitude. It was as if I saw my whole life from a spectator's perspective. I realized that regardless of the failures, I still make good of the situation. My whole mantra changed from ""I fucked up"" to ""it is what it is, just make the most of it."" I clearly identified several aspects of my life that must change. But I also realized what is well - it is almost as if a whole SWOT analysis of my life played out in front of me. I made peace with numerous errors of the past, and gained perspective on what life can potentially offer, if I embrace it. Psychedelics did not cure my depression, but it gave me such a clear perspective on what should be done. It gave me new hope. It is now a month since I used it. I still live daily with the new insight that one cannot change the past, but can change the future by making the right choices in the present. My depression symptoms did_ however, reduce and I am hopeful for what the future may offer.  I defined certain objectives that I want to achieve by my next birthday (August) and plan to treat myself with another psychedelic experience during that period, mainly to reflect on how I went about life between Jan and Aug. I believe this experience would be much more beneficial if done in a ""psychedelic assisted therapy "" session. It is a shame that one cannot access such highly effective medical treatment in South Africa."
psychedelics,"I experienced a heightened sense of playfulness and intrigue, insofar as ordinary circumstances became increasingly funnier and even slightly more bizarre - an example of which is upon entering the main room after taking a 'tab' of acid (as referred to in those days in the late 1960's early 1970's) I saw or thought I saw people 'swimming' in the broadloom rug on the living room floor, which I thought was rather hilarious. At the end of the acid trip, someone had placed a little piece of fluff that had been generated by this swimming movement atop the broadloom on the living room floor and stuffed it into the 'bust' of the grandmother of the family, which obviously a sculpture had constructed and which sat in a prominent position. However, I thought it was utterly HILARIOUS and thought this just about sums it all up ... !!! On another note the words came to me loudly and clearly although I knew not how stating ""YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF"" and I think this gave me true knowledge and insight about the way in which THE MIND generates fear which then superimposes itself onto us as reality, This is how I took the meaning of these words to be and in my later studies it would appear that mind has a great deal to do with how we experience 'reality' ie the primacy of consciousness et al."
psychedelics,"During my December summer vacation of 2022 at one of my country's most popular beach holiday destinations, my boyfriend/partner and I decided to take some ""magic mushrooms"" and head to the only ""alternative"" bar in town. It was the day before my 28th birthday_ therefore, we wanted to celebrate. We started our celebration around 15:00 and each took a dose of roughly 2 grams of ""magic mushrooms"". As I've been experimenting with and using psilocybin mushrooms fairly regularly (in various doses) during the previous 6 weeks, mainly as an alternative self-medication for my anxiety and depression (which had reached an all-time high, starting approximately 6 months prior - getting increasingly more debilitating with each passing day and resulting in extremely crippling effects on my ability to function ""normally"" in the world as I knew, saw, and experienced it - and unrelentingly lasting until I had The Experience), I did not experience much of the intense sensations usually expected and produced with the consumption of psilocybin mushrooms. However, even though my psychedelic experience lacked intense hallucinations, such as the world warping and defying the laws of physics, colours did seem to be slightly brighter than what I reasonably expect them to normally be. Further, I experienced some feelings of happiness and calmness, fluctuating in their intensity, for an hour or so after the initial effects of the psilocybin set in. Somewhere during the time we arrived at the bar and after the mushrooms ""kicked in"", my partner and I met a guy, similarly aged, around the pool table. We both instantly connected with this refreshingly authentic guy and, after chatting with him for a while, we learned that he is also somewhat experienced in taking psychedelics. So, I offered him some of the remaining 20 grams of mushrooms we had been safely keeping in the car. He gladly accepted and offered us some of the LSD that he had in return. He warned us by saying that the LSD he had was pretty ""potent"" before giving it to us, but having taken LSD a couple of times before, I wasn't intimidated. After taking the LSD drop and almost two hours had passed, I was still not feeling any of its effects. The guy we met at the pool table, subsequently offered me more, which I accepted. He proceeded to attempt to distribute another drop of LSD to me_ however, unlike the first time where he carefully placed a single drop of LSD on my finger for me to lick off, he squeezed the little bottle of LSD directly into my mouth and accidentally squirted out a significantly large amount of liquid. After a short moment of freaking out about the ridiculous amount of LSD I just took, I accepted the situation and started to mentally prepare myself for what I was about to experience. In an attempt to support me in my current situation, the pool table guy and my boyfriend both decided to join in for the ride, and also took a similar amount of LSD as to what I had accidentally taken. Not long after taking the LSD, it started kicking in. About an hour after the initial effects started surfacing, the whole world around me and the core of my existence had changed. For the first time in months, I was finally able to experience a feeling of pure and utter joy. I found myself finally being capable of laughing again. For the first time, after a very long period of not only physically but also emotionally isolating myself from others, I felt connected to every single person around me. It didn't matter whether I knew them or not, I genuinely felt like I cared about and loved each and every one of them.  During my trip, I managed to come to terms with the fact that I am getting older and that I will eventually die (which has been something that I was unable to accept up until that point in my life and had previously caused me great fear and distress whenever I thought about it). The Experience also provided me with the awareness that my current career as a digital marketer was not at all what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and that I should finally try to follow my passion and dream of becoming a singer (I have since signed a deal with a record label and recorded my first single). It further made me realise that I was not happy with living in the city and had to start making plans to move to the countryside (which is currently in motion).  Most importantly, The Experience gave me a sense of contentment. While it made me aware of all the things that I wanted and needed to change in my life, it simultaneously made me accept my life as it was at the time, which ended up relieving most of the anxiety and feelings of depression that I felt prior to The Experience. This gave me the strength to start working towards my goals again."
psychedelics,
psychedelics,"It's impossible to write down what happened, and to put into words how huge, how powerful, how beautiful this experience has been. I have felt the strongest connection with nature, with my friends, with the present moment I was living. Never felt like this before, never this strong. A sense of beauty, power, connection, friendship, freedom, aliveness, holiness was pervading me and everything around me. Nothing was out of its place. Everything was in its right place, in the right moment, as it supposed to be. No fears, no judgements, no tiredness, only an incredible displacement of pure existence in its more beautiful manifestation. A sense of ecstasy, of joy, a sense of being ""fucked"" by the earth and being part of it. Never felt so strong, so powerful, so right and conscious of the perfectness of the existence as in that moment."
psychedelics,"You are okay I took approximately half of what I was told was 5 grams of dried psilocybe cubensis mushrooms. I was home alone and it was a wintry sunday evening. This was my second experience with psilocybin, my first dose was 1 gram. My apartment at the time was a small one bedroom loft, maybe 30 square meters total. Maybe 20 minutes after ingestion I start to feel it. Joe Rogan's face on the screen starts to look ominous. I shut the tv and try to relax but can't. Anxiety increases. An hour in I feel very anxious and overwhelmed. I think of calling my then girlfriend but choose not to (I hadn't told her what i was doing that night). I decide to put my headphones on and choose an album: Tired Sounds by Stars of the Lid. As the soothing drones of the first track hit me I close my eyes. I see a face. It's a friend of mine and she is smiling. After that my girlfriend's face appears in the same vision. Tears start to flood my eyes. Anxiety completely dissolves, and suddenly I am filled with a ridiculously overwhelming sensation of bliss. I cry and laugh at the same time. I feel vast gratitude for the people I have in my life. ""You are okay"", was the message I felt I was receiving. For the next hour or so I just think of my friends and family, and every time I remember a new person I'm filled with joy for having him or her in my life. Feelings of immense gratitude flood my mind. I am okay. After this the experience shifts a bit. I begin to pay attention to my surroundings. The patterns on my curtains seem to be breathing, but overall, visual changes are rather moderate. I also feel a presence_ something is watching over me, sort of holding my metaphysical hand as I peek into this literally awesome version of existing. Gratitude is still very present. And I am ok. I notice a physical oddity: I began to yawn frequently and I feel quite weary. Sleeping is completely out of the question and I don't want sleep either. From time to time I feel an urge to go for a smoke. I was trying to quit at the time, and everytime I felt an urge for nicotine I was able to shut the feeling down just because I felt so good. It also felt like a wrong thing to do. Why would I do something pointless and harmful to myself especially now while I am experiencing probably the most beautiful thing in my life? Cigarettes had no place in this. And again, I felt a presence with me, and I was ok. Maybe 3 hours after dosing the intensity starts to mellow out. I leave my sofa, where I've been laying. Now I have this childlike wonder in me: how the water runs from the faucet is beyond interesting and fun_ candy feels bizarre in my mouth_ I observe my apartment from my balcony bed with an interest I still can't quite fathom. I message a friend of mine as the urge tell someone about what I've been through is now strong. Then the trip slowly and peacefully comes to and end. I eat and go to sleep. I will be okay, I thought."
psychedelics,"There was an intention setting and intake appt the day before where we talked about what I wanted from the experience, did some somatic work that day as well. The medicine day was letting the medicine take effect while listening to music and having some grounding touch therapy on my feet/lower legs. We were working with past trauma, some early developmental and doing somatic work of feeling into the feelings I have in my body at the time and in the present while imagining the scenario. Therapist reaffirmed what I said and repeated my words. I had insight into my patterns and where those patterns originated. Some I could not articulate and she encouraged me back to feeling the sensation. Took 3-MMC and did this work for about 4-5 hours and then was given Ketamine amount unknown and experienced colours and patterns and bliss and sense of not being in my body."
psychedelics,"My memory is quite vague as it was almost 5 years ago. But it was my first (remembered) mystical experience and it changed my worldview in some ways. Most clearly, it made me convinced that consciousness is fundamental and that all is one.  My clearest memory is of ""seeing"" what I would perhaps call ""the conscious spacetime"" as a kind of folded and crinkled sheet, and this image was felt to explain everything: that we experience ourselves to be separate is just because we are trapped as a wrinkle in the structure, and other selves are (or are trapped in) other wrinkles. There was a strong feeling of being freed, being let out of entrapment, and coming home to something which was already known. If I had been asked before that I do not think I would have strongly endorsed the idea of consciousness as fundamental and all as one, but the feeling was that I always knew.  The situation: I was in a borrowed apartment with a friend as a sitter, in a setting inspired by Michael Pollan's book How to change your mind (music, lying down, mostly quiet etc)."
psychedelics,"I saw lot of color and geometric figures, I had less pain in my body and felt relaxed. I am used to take psilocybin to treat chronic cluster headache. It helps to have less attacks and less painful attacks. I am not interested in 'tripping'."
